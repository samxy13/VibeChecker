Medicine,https://old.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/qzu1rc/a_detailed_description_of_how_you_die_from_covid/,8052,599,A detailed description of how you die from COVID in the ICU,"Good morning.
I squeeze your hand.
“It’s Friday at 9 o’clock in the morning.” I look out the window. “Gloomy day. It rained last night.”
You say nothing, because you’re chemically paralyzed and deeply sedated. All the drugs in the world to keep you from trying to breathe. My machine does it much better than you ever will.
I look over the fingers on your left hand. They’re falling off. You’re so sick that I was forced to choose your brain and your bowels to get blood instead of your fingers and toes.
Later that day, I take a long camera and put it down the tube breathing for you. I need to get some of the mucous in your lungs out. I quietly apologize for moving around your tube. It’s in your neck now, a surgically created hole, because the tube in your mouth caused your tongue to bleed. Your heart rate on the monitor shoots up. You’re paralyzed, but this is hurting you. I can tell by your heart rate. I ask your nurse for more medications to drip through your IVs. Please go back to sleep.
I watch your nurse troubleshoot your new kidneys. Except it’s a machine, your kidneys, because they stopped working from the weeks of toxins I gave you to try to keep you alive.
I’m not sure, but you probably don’t know who you are anymore. Your brain is so confused by the forced paralysis, the forced sleep, the inability to think, that you’ve become lost. Who are you?
Your family wants you to live, as every loved one wants for their person, so every day I watch your body die a little more. Every day I add a new medication to stave off the inevitable. A new side effect. You haven’t had a bowel movement in weeks. Your body is starving.
Eventually, your immune system and your body can’t fight off the bacteria living in your own body, your own skin, the normal things in the air. The bacteria take hold. They start using your blood to grow. They fill up your lungs with their damage. I add more medications.
I watch your last weeks alive. I watch your organs fail. I watch your fingers fall off. I watch your skin stop being able to protect your muscles and fat and just wear away in places. I watch your last few weeks alive, not knowing who you are, forcefully keeping you asleep. I hope you don’t feel this.
In 25 days, I will tell your family that despite every possible forceful thing I can do to keep you alive, your last little bit is now dying too. It might be your heart, starved for oxygen and trying so hard to keep up that it finally couldn’t squeeze any more. It might be your brain, where weeks of dying finally gave you a stroke.
If they’re kind, your family will tell me to keep you asleep and let you die. If they don’t believe me, I will spend my last moments with you watching someone crack every rib in your chest. A demand to your broken body that I can no longer demand. Stay alive.
I am angry for you. I am angry someone lied to you. I am angry that you were taken advantage of, for reasons I will never understand.
If you have not been vaccinated against COVID-19, this is how you die from it.
Please reconsider. You are wrong. Please give the small part of you that whispers, maybe I have been lied to, give it a chance.
Do not die like this.

So I went through each disease for which the child would be vaccinated today.
I told them about diphtheria and the 30% mortality rate, how diphtheria toxin is one of the most toxic substances known, as a single molecule can kill a cell.  I told them about how this disease use to terrify communities.
They'd already heard of tetanus.  Everyone has heard of tetanus.
I told them about pertussis and the baby I saw who coughed and coughed and coughed and coughed and coughed...until he went into laryngospasm.  We did everything we could.  I will never forget his mother throwing herself at our feet begging us to not say what we were going to say.  I let that family see the tears playing in my eyes as I described the memory.  They needed to know that I am doing this
because I fucking care.
Not because of some quality metric.
We'd already discussed how hepatitis B is spread by nonsexual transmission and how in the prevaccine era, as many as 65% of infants born to HBV positive
fathers
had HBV by the tme they were a year old.  We talked about how that is a life sentence before age 1.
They know about polio.
I talked about the baby I watched die of pneumococcal sepsis.  Another mother at our feet.  Another family destroyed by a microbe.
I described a cricoidotomy in graphic detail.
I was admitted for rotavirus in February of 1979.  I still have the hospital bill for $20.  My mother told me about how sick I was.  And 25 years later, I became a resident and I saw babies with rotavirus.  You could hear the diarrhea from across the emergency department.  We had to do our own IVs at the NYC hospital.  The babies were just so sick and all we could do was keep them hydrated and wait for them to recover.  And then in the fall of 2006 the rotavirus vaccine came out.  And in February of 2008 I was the senior on the floor and... there weren't any rotavirus kids.  It was just gone.
And I asked that mother, now that she'd asked me which vaccines were important, I was going to turn the questions around.  Which ones did
she
think were important?
That baby got every recommended immunization today.   I won.  RFJ Jr. lost.  The parents won; that mother won't be throwing herself at my feet.
Most importantly, the baby won.

Medicine,https://old.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/ff8hns/testimony_of_a_surgeon_working_in_bergamo_in_the/,4163,510,"Testimony of a surgeon working in Bergamo, in the heart of Italy's coronavirus outbreak","«In one of the non-stop e-mails that I receive from my hospital administration on a more than daily basis, there was a paragraph on ""how to be responsible on social media"", with some recommendations that we all can agree on. After thinking for a long time if and what to write about what's happening here, I felt that silence was not responsible. I will therefore try to convey to lay-people, those who are more distant from our reality, what we are experiencing in Bergamo during these Covid-19 pandemic days. I understand the need not to panic, but when the message of the danger of what is happening is not out, and I still see people ignoring the recommendations and people who gather together complaining that they cannot go to the gym or play soccer tournaments, I shiver. I also understand the economic damage and I am also worried about that. After this epidemic, it will be hard to start over.
Still, beside the fact that we are also devastating our national health system from an economic point of view, I want to point out that the public health damage that is going to invest the country is more important and I find it nothing short of ""chilling"" that new quarantine areas requested by the Region has not yet been established for the municipalities of Alzano Lombardo and Nembro (I would like to clarify that this is purely personal opinion). I myself looked with some amazement at the reorganization of the entire hospital in the previous week, when our current enemy was still in the shadows: the wards slowly ""emptied"", elective activities interrupted, intensive care unit freed to create as many beds as possible. Containers arriving in front of the emergency room to create diversified routes and avoid infections. All this rapid transformation brought in the hallways of the hospital an atmosphere of surreal silence and emptiness that we did not understand, waiting for a war that had yet to begin and that many (including me) were not so sure would never come with such ferocity (I open a parenthesis: all this was done in the shadows, and without publicity, while several newspapers had the courage to say that private health care was not doing anything).
I still remember my night shift a week ago spent without any rest, waiting for a call from the microbiology department. I was waiting for the results of a swab taken from the first suspect case in our hospital, thinking about what consequences it would have for us and the hospital. If I think about it, my agitation for one possible case seems almost ridiculous and unjustified, now that I have seen what is happening. Well, the situation is now nothing short of dramatic. No other words come to mind. The war has literally exploded and battles are uninterrupted day and night. One after the other, these unfortunate people come to the emergency room. They have far from the complications of a flu. Let's stop saying it's a bad flu. In my two years working in Bergamo, I have learned that the people here do not come to the emergency room for no reason. They did well this time too. They followed all the recommendations given: a week or ten days at home with a fever without going out to prevent contagion, but now they can't take it anymore. They don't breathe enough, they need oxygen. Drug therapies for this virus are few.
The course mainly depends on our organism. We can only support it when it can't take it anymore. It is mainly hoped that our body will eradicate the virus on its own, let's face it. Antiviral therapies are experimental on this virus and we learn its behavior day after day. Staying at home until the symptoms worsen does not change the prognosis of the disease. Now, however, that need for beds in all its drama has arrived. One after another, the departments that had been emptied are filling up at an impressive rate. The display boards with the names of the sicks, of different colors depending on the department they belong to, are now all red and instead of the surgical procedure, there is the diagnosis, which is always the same: bilateral interstitial pneumonia. Now, tell me which flu virus causes such a rapid tragedy.
Because that's the difference (now I get a little technical): in classical flu, besides that it infects much less population over several months, cases are complicated less frequently: only when the virus has destroyed the protective barriers of our airways and as such it allows bacteria (which normally resident in the upper airways) to invade the bronchi and lungs, causing a more serious disease. Covid 19 causes a banal flu in many young people, but in many elderly people (and not only) a real SARS because it invades the alveoli of the lungs directly, and it infects them making them unable to perform their function. The resulting respiratory failure is often serious and after a few days of hospitalization, the simple oxygen that can be administered in a ward may not be enough. Sorry, but to me, as a doctor, it's not reassuring that the most serious are mainly elderly people with other pathologies. The elderly population is the most represented in our country and it is difficult to find someone who, above 65 years of age, does not take at least a pill for high blood pressure or diabetes.
I can also assure you that when you see young people who end up intubated in the ICU, pronated or worse, in ECMO (a machine for the worst cases, which extracts the blood, re-oxygenates it and returns it to the body, waiting for the lungs to hopefully heal), all this confidence for your young age goes away. And while there are still people on social media who boast of not being afraid by ignoring the recommendations, protesting that their normal lifestyle habits have ""temporarily"" halted, the epidemiological disaster is taking place. And there are no more surgeons, urologists, orthopedists, we are only doctors who suddenly become part of a single team to face this tsunami that has overwhelmed us.
The cases multiply, up to a rate of 15-20 hospitalizations a day all for the same reason. The results of the swabs now come one after the other: positive, positive, positive. Suddenly the emergency room is collapsing. Emergency provisions are issued: help is needed in the emergency room. A quick meeting to learn how the to use to emergency room EHR and a few minutes later I'm already downstairs, next to the warriors on the war front. The screen of the PC with the chief complaint is always the same: fever and respiratory difficulty, fever and cough, respiratory insufficiency etc ... Exams, radiology always with the same sentence: bilateral interstitial pneumonia. All needs to be hospitalized. Some already needs to be intubated, and goes to the ICU. For others, however, it is late. ICU is full, and when ICUs are full, more are created. Each ventilator is like gold: those in the operating rooms that have now suspended their non-urgent activity are used and the OR become a an ICU that did not exist before. I found it amazing, or at least I can speak for Humanitas Gavazzeni (where I work), how it was possible to put in place in such a short time a deployment and a reorganization of resources so finely designed to prepare for a disaster of this magnitude. And every reorganization of beds, wards, staff, work shifts and tasks is constantly reviewed day after day to try to give everything and even more. Those wards that previously looked like ghosts are now saturated, ready to try to give their best for the sick, but exhausted. The staff is exhausted. I saw fatigue on faces that didn't know what it was despite the already grueling workloads they had. I have seen people still stop beyond the times they used to stop already, for overtime that was now habitual. I saw solidarity from all of us, who never failed to go to our internist colleagues to ask ""what can I do for you now?"" or ""leave that admission to me, i will take care of it."" Doctors who move beds and transfer patients, who administer therapies instead of nurses. Nurses with tears in their eyes because we are unable to save everyone and the vital signs of several patients at the same time reveal an already marked destiny. There are no more shifts, schedules.
Social life is suspended for us. I have been separated for a few months, and I assure you that I have always done my best to constantly see my son even on the day after a night shift, without sleeping and postponing sleep until when I am without him, but for almost 2 weeks I have voluntarily not seen neither my son nor my family members for fear of infecting them and in turn infecting an elderly grandmother or relatives with other health problems. I'm happy with some photos of my son that I look at between tears and a few video calls. So you should be patient too, you can't go to the theater, museums or gym. Try to have mercy on that myriad of older people you could exterminate. It is not your fault, I know, but of those who put it in your head that you are exaggerating and even this testimony may seem just an exaggeration for those who are far from the epidemic, but please, listen to us, try to leave the house only to indispensable things. Do not go en masse to make stocks in supermarkets: it is the worst thing because you concentrate and the risk of contacts with infected people who do not know they are infected. You can go there without a rush. Maybe if you have a normal mask (even those that are used to do certain manual work), put it on. Don't look for ffp2 or ffp3. Those should serve us and we are beginning to struggle to find them. By now we have had to optimize their use only in certain circumstances, as the WHO recently recommended in view of their almost ubiquitous running low. Oh yes, thanks to the shortage of certain protection devices, many colleagues and I are certainly exposed despite all the other means of protection we have. Some of us have already become infected despite the protocols. Some infected colleagues also have infected relatives and some of their family members are already struggling between life and death. We are where your fears could make you stay away. Try to make sure you stay away.
Tell your family members who are elderly or with other illnesses to stay indoors. Bring him the groceries please. We have no alternative. It's our job. Indeed what I do these days is not really the job I'm used to, but I do it anyway and I will like it as long as it responds to the same principles: try to make some sick people feel better and heal, or even just alleviate the suffering and the pain to those who unfortunately cannot heal. I don't spend a lot of words about the people who define us heroes these days and who until yesterday were ready to insult and report us. Both will return to insult and report as soon as everything is over. People forget everything quickly. And we're not even heroes these days. It's our job. We risked something bad every day before: when we put our hands in a belly full of someone's blood we don't even know if they have HIV or hepatitis C; when we do it even though we know they have HIV or hepatitis C; when we stick ourselves during an operation on a patient with HIV and take the drugs that make us vomit all day long for a month. When we read with anguish the results of the blood tests after an accidental needlestick, hoping not to be infected. We simply earn our living with something that gives us emotions. It doesn't matter if they are beautiful or ugly, we just take them home. In the end we only try to make ourselves useful for everyone. Now try to do it too, though: with our actions we influence the life and death of a few dozen people. You with yours, many more. Please share and share the message. We need to spread the word to prevent what is happening here from happening all over Italy.»

Medicine,https://old.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/4g8pf8/he_is_small_for_an_eightyearold_boy_made_even/,4088,624,"He is small for an eight-year-old boy, made even smaller by the big trauma room gurney beneath him...","He is small for an eight-year-old boy, made even smaller by the big trauma room gurney beneath him. Two skinny, sunburnt legs stick out from a pair of much too large, frayed, hand-me-down cutoffs. Green grass stains cover the skin of both knees. His bare feet are filthy, farm boy filthy. The kind of filthy that comes from playing in the cool dirt of an old barn floor, from running through uncut fields of wheat alongside the combines, and from climbing the giant hay bales that dot the rolling hills this time of year.
Two hours ago he was just another shirtless boy in a cowboy hat playing in the wheat.
His mother stands across from me. She is perhaps thirty-two. She has sandy blonde hair, just like the boy on the gurney. I can’t see her face because it is buried in her husband’s chest. She is completely silent but her whole body shakes, trembling like an old John Deere combine with something stuck in its blades. Her husband pulls her tight, his arms wrapping around her, trying to protect her from this place, this moment.
The two of them clutch to each other, here, in my emergency room.
At the head of the bed the ventilator chimes and puffs and clicks along as it pushes air into the boy. It pushes air into lungs that collapsed and now have chest tubes draining them. Lungs that cried out just loud enough to stop thirty thousand pounds of combine from turning the boy into chaff with the wheat.
The boy’s arm twitches. The nurse next to me blinks back tears and adjusts his IV.
A case like this is a bomb that detonates in our ER, in our town, in our lives. The shockwaves right now are spreading as neighbors call neighbors, as friends call friends, as family reaches out for family and parents run to check on their children. I know I will not be the only one unable to sleep tonight.
The father stares at his son on the gurney. His face is filled with questions for which I have no answers. How can this happen? How can something we love, something so full of life, be so fragile, so vulnerable, so easily cut down and taken from us in the blink of an eye?
He does not know it yet but he is now standing in a new life. A life that will always be different from the one he woke up to this morning.
I step over to the computer to order some more sedation for the boy while we wait for the helicopter. Taped above the screen is a brand new sign. It is a decal of five gold stars. It seems so out of place at a moment like this. The last few weeks the hospital has been putting them up everywhere. They are there to remind us to give ‘five-star’ service- to tell our patients how much we appreciate their business and hope they will choose us for their future healthcare needs.
They are to be called customers now, not patients, we are told.
Customers.
I tear it off the screen and wrinkle it in my hand into a ball, squeezing it tight. I shove it in the pocket of my white coat.
Twenty-two minutes later the whine of the helicopter engine fills the air as it prepares for takeoff. I stand outside with the father, watching the big blades spin up to speed in the late August light. Inside the helicopter there is room enough for only one parent to go with the boy. One hundred and three miles away a pediatric ICU bed is waiting.
The helicopter lifts off and a cloud of late summer dust fills the air. The father does not move as the debris cloud swirls about his head. Instead, he stares at the window on the side of the helicopter, the dark outline of his son just visible to us both.
We watch the helicopter rise above the pad and rotate slowly. It climbs a little further, hesitates in the air, and then races off above the wheat fields, the grains below bowing from the thrust of its blades.
I take out the five-star decal from my pocket, unfolding it carefully. I tear it in two and press the larger half against the brick wall behind us. I scribble my home phone number on the back.
“Let me know,” I say.
The father takes the paper and nods, still staring at the shrinking outline of the helicopter. At last it disappears over the mountains in the distance. He turns to me but his eyes are empty now. He is already departing, already arriving at the next place. We shake hands and he walks slowly off to his truck. He’s got a long, quiet drive to the city ahead of him.
I look down at what’s left of the ripped up decal in my hand.
The image of the boy burns bright in my mind. I know I will carry this day with me for a very long time.
I make a fist, crumpling the decal.
I respectfully disagree with those who want us to call them customers, healthcare consumers, or business opportunities.
The people we care for are sons and daughters. Mothers and fathers. Husbands and wives. They are neighbors, friends, and sometimes even colleagues.
They are people like you and me in a moment of need.
They are patients.
Addendum:
When I wrote this I thought maybe a couple dozen people would want to discuss it. I had no idea it would blow up like this. A couple short points:
I really appreciate everyone's comments and insights- from the administrators, to the patients, to others in healthcare. I have learned a great deal just from reading your posts and I hope others have too. Those of you who share your insights and experiences with others are truly the best of reddit.
To those determined to find and dox the boy in the story I say this: You are welcome to keep trying but you won't find him. Out of respect for my patients and because of HIPAA I always change enough details of anything I write in a way that makes it impossible to find the individual while staying true to what happened. I will say the original patient who inspired this story several years ago ended up fine.
To those of you who asked if I have written anything else I wrote a book of short stories about being an ER doc in a small town. It's here if you are interested.

I work in a small conservative rural town providing primary care exclusively to Medicaid patients.  I live in a big city 200 miles away and for the last five years, have commuted to this job to work M-W. The clinic I am at was stood up after the ACA’s Medicaid expansion to give patients a PCP instead of having them rely on frequent visits to the ER. I have loved this job.  I work three days a week.  The pay is great. I get to care for the poor and underserved.  I like to think I have made a pretty big difference in the community.
COVID has come with its stressors.  Being a small conservative community, I have heard every conspiracy theory possible about COVID. Everyday it is me trying to educate and push back against the misinformation.  Everyday is a fight to get people to wear masks (including coworkers). Everyday is a futile attempt to get people to get vaccinated.  I have a panel of a thousand patients and to my continuing horror, I have only been able to talk one patient that was on the fence into getting the vaccine.
I have vials of vaccines in the medication fridge ready to go but nobody to wants them.
Nobody believes COVID is real or a serious issue.  It is all a big “libtard” conspiracy. Yet this county has one of the highest infection rates in the state.
The supervising physician, the medical assistants, and the office manager are all unvaccinated. There is a second PA but they had a bad reaction to the first shot and never went back for the second. I am literally the only person in the organization that is fully vaccinated.  They have refused to get vaccinated and have had no plans to get vaccinated.  In fact, they have dissuaded patients out of getting the vaccine.  I keep working there despite this because I think I am doing good for my patients and the community and feel compelled to “fight the good fight.”
Last week, our governor announced a mandate that all teachers and healthcare workers get vaccinated (barring legitimate medical exemption).
Today, the office manager told me that they may have to close the clinic down because none of them are willing to get vaccinated. They would rather shut things down and abandon the patients and our service to the community than to “get the jab.”
I gave notice today.  I can’t work there anymore. I am at a point where the pay and perks aren’t enough. I can’t argue about it anymore. There is no educating or persuading.  I just can’t do it.
I have pretty much lost all faith in people.
Edit:
Wow.  Thank you for the support! Last night was a little raw. It was nice to wake up and read this.  Well... back to the clinic for a few more weeks. The grind goes on. :)",

6am - Wake up. Roll off of my pile of money that Big Pharma gave me. Softly weep as it doesn’t put a dent in my medical school loans
6:30am - Make breakfast, using only foods from the diet that gives me everlasting life by avoiding all fats, sugars, carbs, and proteins. For details buy my book and check out my shop.
7am - Get to work, load up my syringes with coronavirus before rounds.
8am - See my patients for the day. Administer the medications that the government tells me to. Covertly rub essential oils on the ones I want to get better.
9:30am - Call Bill Gates to check how 5G tower construction is going, hoping for more coronavirus soon. He tells me they’re delayed due to repairs on the towers used to spread the Black Plague. Curse the fact that this is the most efficient way to spread infectious diseases.
10am - One patient tells me he knows “the truth” about coronavirus. I give him a Tdap booster. He becomes autistic in front of my eyes. He’ll never conspire against me again.
11am - Tend to the secret hospital garden of St. John’s wort and ginkgo leaves that we save for rich patients and donors.
12:30pm - Pick up my briefcase of money from payroll, my gift from Pfizer for the incomprehensible profits we make off of the free influenza vaccine given every year.
1pm - Conference call with Dr. Fauci and the lab in Wuhan responsible for manufacturing viruses. Tell them my idea about how an apocalypse-style zombie virus would be a cool one to try for the next batch.
2pm - A patient starts asking me about getting rid of toxins. I ask her if she has a liver and kidneys. She tells me she knows “the truth” about Big Anatomy and that the only way to detoxify herself is to eat nothing but lemon wedges and mayonnaise for weeks. I give her a Tdap booster.
2:45pm - Help the FBI, CIA, and CDC silence the masses. Lament the fact that I can only infringe on one or two of their rights. Oh well, there’s always tomorrow.
4pm - One of my rich patients begins to crash. Laugh as I realize I’ve mismatched her spirit animal and zodiac moon sign. I switch out the Purple Amethyst above her bed for a Tiger’s Eye geode. She stabilizes. I throw some ginkgo leaves on her for good measure
6pm - Go onto YouTube and see coronavirus conspiracy videos everywhere. Curse my all powerful government for how inept they are at keeping people from spreading “the truth”
6:10pm - Go onto Amazon and see that a book about “the truth” is the #1 seller this week. Question the power of my all powerful government. Make a reminder to myself to get more Tdap boosters from the Surgeon General next time we talk.
7pm - Time to go home. Before I leave, sacrifice a goat to Dr. Fauci and say three Hippocratic Oaths.
9pm - Take a contented sigh as I snuggle under the covers made of the tinfoil hats of my enemies, realizing that my 4 years of medical school and 3 years of residency training have been put to good use today.

Sure, you had a health scare when you were in your mid 30s, a pretty big scare come to think of it. You had some chest pain whenever you worked too hard and went to a heart doctor and after a bunch of tests wound up getting some kind of mesh tube in your heart. Or something. Doesn't matter. You see your heart doctor every year and he tells you you're fine. Maybe lose a couple pounds. Here's a pill you should take for your blood pressure. Maybe you know the name of it, maybe you don't. But you still see your heart doctor, even two decades later, because you want to be healthy.
Your other doctor worries about your sugars. He tells you to take a different pill. Metformin. You know that one's name. Your other doctor also tells you to lose some weight. And he says he doesn't like how high this blood test number is. But you feel fine. It doesn't hurt like the chest pain you had.
Maybe you work at a gas station. Maybe you're a public notary, doesn't matter. You're definitely blue collar. Hair's thinning and mostly grey, you keep it buzzed pretty close to the scalp. You haven't shaven for the past week or so it seems, because you got sick.
You come down with the flu. Fevers that leave you sweating and chills that put you under the extra blankets you keep on the top shelf of your closet. You don't take a temperature though. You just feel awful. And the cough keeps you up at night. You're not coughing up any goo though, so that's good. Right?
You put up with it for a week. The fevers aren't going away. What's more worrying is that it's getting harder to breathe. Not the kind of hard to breathe when you had your heart issue, no, this is taking the wind from you when you walk the length of your room to go take a wiz. So you overcome your stubbornness and go to an Urgent Care.
This new doctor says he doesn't like the sound of your lungs and orders a chest Xray. Your new doctor says you have pneumonia and gives you two more pills to take. Antibiotics. They'll help you start breathing better again.
But you don't start breathing better. And the fevers only go away for a little when you take Tylenol. And you're having to breathe faster now even in bed. You wait three more days, taking the antibiotics which were supposed to fix you, until you're scared enough to head to the Emergency Room. Because you can't breathe.
The nurses put some tubing under your nose and now you don't have to breathe so hard. You're seen by yet another new doctor in the afternoon. He's wearing a lot of stuff your other doctors never wore. It's hard to hear him as he speaks through two masks. He probably says something about that virus that’s going around. The COVID virus. And you're shocked because you thought it was the flu, and you haven't been around any sick people. You don't know where you got it from.
Four hours later a different doctor comes by (also wearing a lot of masks and a yellow dress) and says you're heading upstairs. He asks you even more questions. By this time, you had to switch to a face mask to get enough oxygen to breathe ok.
You spend the night in the hospital. You're woken up at 11PM, 1AM, 2AM, and 5AM for a nurse to come take your vitals. If you take your mask off for even a minute, you feel like you've just run up 2 flights of stairs.
Your newest doctors (there's a few of them) wake you up around 8AM. They listen to your lungs, look at the monitor next to your bed that beeps sometimes, and frown. You can tell even under the masks. They say you're going to get different pills. One of them isn't usually used to treat the COVID, but you're desperate to breathe and you agree to it.
Your nurse keeps coming into your room to check your monitor a few times in an hour. You're breathing just as fast as you were at home, even with the mask of oxygen on.
Suddenly there's a lot of talk outside your room. Maybe you can make it out over the sound of the whooshing air into the mask and your own breathing, maybe not. Doesn't matter.
If you were listening, you'd hear an anesthesiologist asking why he was called stat to the room when a decision hasn't been made yet to intubate or not. (Intubate. Do you know what that word means?) You hear a different doctor ask why they weren't called earlier to first evaluate the patient before the anesthesiologist was called. After a minute or two you see a tall doctor (you’ve lost track of how many new doctors you’ve seen) enter your room, again with the masks, and the yellow dress.
Things start to move faster now.
He speaks quickly but seemingly without worry in his voice. ""How are you feeling?"" (Did he even pause to introduce himself? You can't remember.) You answer in clipped words. ""It's not hard to breathe,"" you say, ""but I just can't catch my breath.""
He explains that your oxygen is too low despite the mask. And he says the only way to help you keep breathing is to stick a plastic tube down your throat and hook you up to a machine. He explains you'll be asleep while it's in. You agree, because why the hell wouldn't you?
He exits just as quickly as he came in. Again, if you're listening closely, outside the door you hear him say to some people you can't see, ""We don’t need to intubate in the room, we've got a good five or ten minutes before he goes south. Get him to the pack you.""
You probably didn’t hear that last thing right.
You're rolled out of your room in your stretcher to an elevator. You go up and are wheeled into a busy room of lines with beds of other people with tubes down their throats, with only drapes to separate them. You’re pushed past dozens of people in yellow dresses and masks and plastic windshields on their face. There's more of those same dings and bells you heard from your own monitor, but they're all over the room echoing off the floors and walls and ceiling.
Another doctor says you're going to go to sleep. You look scared. You don’t ask any questions, you just keep breathing. The monitor behind you keeps dinging.
You don't even realize they pushed the medicine into your veins in the two seconds it takes for you to stop feeling or hearing anything.
…
Maybe you remember being in a fog as the medicine wore off a little. Maybe. You choke on the thing in your throat. Your eyes well up. Then you go back to sleep less than a minute later when you're given more medicine. You hope you don’t remember that.
Now you're wherever we go when we sleep.
You hope you wake up.",

Family told they have no choice due to Heartbeat bill,"https://www.11alive.com/article/news/local/family-claims-atlanta-nurse-declared-brain-dead-kept-alive-pregnancy/85-eac5257d-a329-4dd7-b80f-5c0ecd30225a
The family of a 30-year-old metro Atlanta mother and nurse said she was declared brain dead more than 90 days ago — but is still being kept alive because she’s pregnant.
Adriana Smith, a registered nurse at Emory University Hospital, was nearly nine weeks pregnant in early February when she started experiencing intense headaches.
According to her mother, April Newkirk, Smith sought treatment at Northside Hospital but was released after being given medication. Smith was declared brain dead. Her family has been by her side every day since, including her young son, who they said still believes his mother is just sleeping. She’s been breathing through machines for more than 90 days,” Newkirk said. “It’s torture for me. I see my daughter breathing, but she’s not there. And her son—I bring him to see her.”
Newkirk said doctors told the family the baby has fluid on the brain and they're not sure how much fluid. They're concerned about his health.“She’s pregnant with my grandson. But he may be blind, may not be able to walk, may not survive once he’s born,” Newkirk said.
Under Georgia’s heartbeat law, abortion is banned once cardiac activity is detected — typically around six weeks into pregnancy.  The law includes limited exceptions for rape, incest, or if the mother’s life is in danger. But in Adriana’s case, the law created a legal gray area.
Because she is brain dead — no longer considered at risk herself — her medical team is legally required to maintain life support until the fetus reaches viability. The family said doctors told them they are not legally allowed to consider other options.
Not mentioned in this article but she was 9 weeks pregnant when she died. Insane to me that apparently the only legal option to turn her into a zombie incubator for 6-7 months.",

“The residents should run the Code Blues, they’re probably better trained than us.”
I’ll start off with what is good.
We’re becoming more adept at treating COVID cases. With a growing census of confirmed COVID positive patients (10 COVID positive in a census of 16 today), we’re getting a better sense of how this bastard virus behaves. There are the easy presentations: 40F w/ no significant PMH presenting w/ a 7 day hx of fever, dry cough, fatigue found to have bilateral ground glass infiltrates, elevated LFTs, lymphocytopenia and even fucking hypokalemia on admission. Might as well not even swab to confirm. (But the ED will, oh yes, because now they’re swabbing everyone and costing us probably 30-40 PPE kits per admission while we wait the 24 hours for the COVID test to result.)
But then there was the subtle one: 73M w/ multiple comorbidities who was diagnosed with simple CHF exacerbation and sepsis secondary to a UTI (positive UA and UCx) who was tubed on arrival to the ED, admitted straight to the ICU, found to be COVID negative 3/21. He is taken off the vent within 24 hours and discharged to the floors. Because he’s COVID negative you see. We treat him with antibiotics, work up his NSTEMI which he managed to throw in during his first day admitted and kind of take mild interest in his recurrent fevers. But he’s not coughing and is satting well.
Yesterday, my team and I thought “This guy has a normal white count, elevated LFTs and recurrent fevers. Forget the last test, order a repeat COVID.” I do this several hours before speaking with the attending physician. During table rounds, he pointedly asked me if I was aware of the protocols the Command Center had put in place for repeat testing. I say no, as these protocols change every day. (Side note: N95s are now rated for indefinite use, not just 4 days. Hope we didn’t toss all those other ones away for no reason!) “Cancel the test, let’s get Infectious Disease on board and ask them their input.”
I put in for the ID consult, I... ""forget"" to cancel the COVID repeat or inform the Command Center. Busy day as you saw from yesterday. Comes back positive.
We know what this bastard virus looks like.
But we spent 2-3 days in his room without our N95s on.
We would have spent more in there had we not tested.
We’re still early, but we know how fast or how slow a case progresses. Our younger patients, the 41F and the 49M might get discharged to home quarantine as early as tomorrow! They’re not reliant on supplemental oxygen and haven’t had fevers for >24 hours. Our older patients aren’t as lucky. No one on our census so far has been intubated. The 73M whose COVID we caught late rapidly progressed to requiring supplemental oxygen and was transferred to the SICU as the last stop before ventilator land.
We’re getting better as a team of residents. We’re all more than a little scared. I’ve talked to my favorite resident / current carpool buddy / best second-in-command about my anxiety about this situation. How the adrenaline kicks in when I’m on the floors and makes me feel less afraid and more focused. The crash after work is awful and the anxiety kicking back in takes a drink or two to knock down, but fuck it, I’m better at my work when I’m not terrified.
Oh and the food remains the best part of the day. Thank you, local places that sent great sandwiches for lunch and Greek for dinner. Makes the rest of this easier to write about.
Now on to what’s not good.
The hospital is now greater than 2/3rds COVID cases. The ratio of ventilators for COVID patients to non-COVID patients is 7:1.
We’re maxed out on the capacity of our Intensivists, intensivist PAs, and Anesthesiologists. The sprawl of the traditional ICU has taken over essentially anything that used to be elevated care and we’re still scrambling for beds. A handful of Internal and Family Med Hospitalists are being recruited to act as lieutenant Intensivists overseeing the ventilated. I mean lieutenant in its original definition: ""substitute,” “deputy,"" literally ""place holder."" They report to the Intensivists directly.
At lunch today, it was declared that due to the sheer number of Rapid Responses and Codes, and due to the overwhelming census of the Greater ICU, Residents responding to Rapid Responses are not expected to get any Intensivist backup.
I’m no stranger to Rapid Responses. You hear the call over the PA and are given a floor, you rush upstairs and enter a room blind with someone either choking, or unconscious, or bleeding, or seizing, or with a heart rate incompatible with life. You remain calm, you ask the patient questions while asking the nurses to give a summary of the patient’s medical background, current admission issues, latest changes, vitals, labs, imaging. Scary, but doable.
During the meeting, the Medical Director said the Hospitalists would be asked to run Code Blues. The Hospitalists balked.
See, Intensivists ran
every single Code Blue
in the hospital before now. One Hospitalist said, “We haven’t run a Code since residency! The residents should run the Code Blues, they’re probably better trained than us.” The room of a couple dozen full-blown-attending Hospitalists nodded in agreement. I was the only resident there, too stunned to speak up. No final decision was made.
I know the timing of Epi pushes and ACLS algorithms enough that a couple days’ review would cement it pretty well. But the actual pressure of making the call for a defibrillation or a push of atropine or adenosine is so beyond what I’m emotionally prepared for.
CPR is a violent, ugly thing with a fatality rate that is 100% for COVID patients with lungs too full of fluid for their heart pumping to matter. Even if I were to run everything perfectly, the person is still going to die. Let alone if I make the wrong call.
I’ve come to terms with the idea that I’m going to see COVID patients die under my care
a whole fucking lot.
I don’t want to be forced to watch them die under my care from three feet away while I make a series of life or death decisions that are guaranteed to be utterly pointless.
​
​
Day 5
“If you’re going to stroll around here, you’re going to need full PPE”
“Usually takes about 20 minutes, then everyone’s arms get tired”
If this hospital is at war, it’s ceding territory at an alarming rate.
Here’s the layout of the field: we’ve got medsurg wings on the cardinal points of the compass (except 2SW for some reason) in a somewhat random pattern from first floor to fifth: 1N, 2S, 2SW, 3N, 3E, 5E, 5S. The ICU, CCU, CICU, and SICU are floating around the periphery of the 3rd floor.
By the time I started Day 1, 2SW and 5E were already on lockdown and designated as COVID territory. My team alone had a total of two pending and one confirmed COVID cases.
By Day 2, the CICU became a conflict zone and joined 2S and 5E. 5 COVIDS or pendings.
By Day 3, my team had pending tests in 5S as well. 6 COVIDs or pendings.
By Day 4, the 5th and 2nd floors were entirely given over to COVID. 3E still had some non-COVID evacuees waiting to be transferred to the last bastions of 1N and 3N. Everything ending with -CU is overrun by this point.
It’s Day 5. My census stands at 15, of which 9 are COVID positive. There’s talk of clearing out 1N sooner or later even.
The hospital is fairing less well: of the 170 or so inpatients (not counting the 25 or so Greater ICU COVID positive people on vents), 100 are COVID positive, and a third more have pending tests.
…
So those are the numbers. Actually walking the halls puts the change from Day 1 to Day 5 in starker contrast.
The amount of PPE used per nurse or CNA has steadily increased. On any floor (except the Last Bastion wings), if you squint your eyes all you can see is uniform green paper scrubs with blue hairnets and and blue paper booties and blue paper masks +/- an N95 underneath. If you look further down the hall you’ll see a spray of yellow as one of them gowns up to enter a patient’s room. (The nurses have been using Sharpies to write their names on the paper gowns so people can tell each other apart.)
Maybe you’ll spot a Resident in a long white coat rush by.
And by every single door on wheeled tables usually topped with hospital food are boxes and boxes of blue gloves and yellow gowns. Might be my imagination, but the boxes of face masks are disconcertingly not as ubiquitous.
The Greater ICU is less colorful. Just window after window of people on vents. Walk the whole length of it and count maybe one person who’s conscious. Most don’t look like our usual ICU clientele of the cachectic elderly. These are mostly men (my imagination?) ranging from their 50-70s.
I made the mistake of asking who the youngest intubated COVID patient on the unit was.
Younger than me.
So we finish at the ED. It’s not chaotic like a Saturday night. Sure there are a few beds in the hallways, but that’s nothing new. I walked the length of it too. Some people on oxygen here and there, wider variety of ages.
Lots of people getting gowned up to enter rooms though. And I know we’re supposed to take them off at the door of the patient’s room, why are people walking around-
“HEY! If you’re going to stroll around here, you’re going to need full PPE. With an N95 on!”
The ED is now considered COVID home territory.
…
I don’t feel like a soldier. I don’t feel brave for showing up to my job. I most certainly don’t feel like a hero.
I feel like the tide came in way too fast and now I'm staring at waves from below.

Day 6
“There’s another Anesthesia Stat. Don’t know where we’re gonna put that one.”
55M with PMH of uncontrolled DM2, HTN, CKD3. Admitted 5 days ago for fever, SoB, dry cough, you get it. COVID positive on Day 1. Went to a COVID medsurg floor, experienced worsening hypoxia on NC, and started on nonrebreather. By Day 5, transferred to the newest territory grab of the Greater ICU, the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit - the PACU. We’re not doing surgeries anymore, so no anesthesia, so that’s free real estate to park the intubated.
One other thing. The PACU was never meant for anything longer than a few hours’ stay and has only drapes between beds. No doors or walls means this is COVID home turf. You have to completely PPE up to even enter the unit.
This newest long walk of ventilated COVID patients is kept alive by 2nd string equipment. No modern touch screens, no real time graphs, just an aged-beige box with some dials and digital-clock-red settings. It does the same job - you can set the PEEP, FiO2, RR, AC/PSV just as precisely as the modern machines.
Even the third tier stuff never intended to serve as ventilation for the 10-14 days of ventilation COVID patients may require works well. These are the surgical ventilators the anesthesiologists used to use back when we did surgeries. They have been liberated to serve the Greater ICU. We’ve even drafted the ad hoc ventilators of the local community of outpatient docs to act as reserves.
Code Blue called on the 55M gentleman above. The team rushes up and I am deeply relieved that it’s not a Code I have to run. By the time we get our PPE on (takes about 3 minutes), he’s already being intubated. No chest compressions required. We put in some orders, we watch the Veteran Attendings tube their first patient of the day. It is only about 8AM.
”Anesthesia Stat to the ED” heard on the overhead PA means someone is getting intubated essentially right after they enter the door. The Intensivist sighs and wonders out loud where they’re going to place this next patient on a vent.
The Greater ICU is quickly becoming The Empire of the ICU as more unused departments get swallowed up by the need to house the intubated.
...
I try to comfort myself with knowing I'm still living in the
good
days, relatively speaking.
No one on the hospital staff is sick. No one on my team or Residency program is sick. I'm not sick. We still have beds and ventilators, at least for the time being.
We've still got a week and a half for this to reach its peak.",

“A beautiful day in hell”
​
The 88F who signed the DNI/DNR was transferred from our service to a sister service also staffed with Residents a few days ago. The hand over occurred for no reason other than she was roomed in a wing that the COVID team recently took over wholesale. My team is no longer in charge of her case. But I’ve been chart-stalking her vitals and prognosis regardless because she’s still my patient.
And the prognosis is not good. Even on a 100% nonrebreather, her sats are in the mid 80s. Without the DNI, she would have been on a ventilator a day or two ago. She’s tachypneic, taking a breath every other second or so. Palliative care has been consulted and she’s been placed on ever increasing amounts of morphine to help curb her air hunger. As of this afternoon, she’s been placed on a morphine drip. She’s still wide awake, but her prognosis is dire.
That’s a word we get to use in charts.
Dire
. Seems almost melodramatic.
I decide to use some of the free time I have on this puddle-grey afternoon to leave my call room bunker and go visit her. I make a brief stop to get an update from her new team. It’s as bad as I thought. I ask if she’s going to make it through the night. Probably. Maybe not tomorrow night though.
I put on the PPE including my shiny new and properly fitted N95 I picked up that morning, and enter the room. I make a point to avoid reading the Fox News's chyron on the room's TV. We make small talk about her lemon ice cup. She likes it, I tell her I like them too and have stolen a fair number of them from the floor’s patient fridge over the years.
She knows something is up. She asks why I’m checking in on her, and I can see her get a little out of breath taking the mask off for even a few seconds then saying one sentence. I say I don’t like the direction her oxygenation is going, and I’m concerned.
“So I’m losing my battle?”
Really starting to hate that metaphor.
""This comes as a surprise.""
She met with our Palliative care team 2 days prior and comfort care was started.
She asks flat out what her prognosis is.
Once again, because I am an idiot, I tell her the truth.
I say that she might be seeing the end of her life sooner rather than later. Maybe less than 1 week at the rate things are going. I avoid using the word
dire
. When she asks if she's dying, I say unfortunately, yes.
""So you transfer me to another doctor and I'm dying. Your team must feel like failures.""
Not a word of that is misquoted or taken out of context.

Day 9
“You want to push another epi?” “Sure, why not.”
​
Overhead on the hospital PA:
“As you know, today is National Doctor’s Day. Let’s conclude this quiet moment by standing where you are and applauding our heroic physicians.”
As that played, half a dozen nurses and I were frantically getting into our PPEs outside a suspected COVID room to rush into a Code Blue.
Surprisingly, no one stopped to applaud.
Inside, the calming voice was drowned out by the hiss of a nonrebreather, the labored expiratory moans of the patient, and the warning dings of the bedside monitor. The bedside monitor was not happy that the patient’s heart rate was somewhere in the high 160s and was letting the room know its opinion on the matter.
Narrow complex ventricular tachycardia. But the patient isn’t hypotensive or otherwise unstable. You don’t lay on the paddles of a defibrillator for that.
“You’re going to feel a little funny for a second,” is what the nurse says to reassure the patient. What she really meant was, “We’re going to stop your heart for a second or two to reset your circuit breaker, so if it feels like you’re dying briefly, it’s because you are.” The nurse draws up some adenosine, the other MD in the room slams the bolus into the patient’s veins, and everybody gets to watch the monitor flatline for a held breath before a heart rate returns. Takes two boluses for it to take.
Problem solved.
For 73 minutes.
Nothing was playing overhead for the second Code Blue. Thankfully, an intensivist was already inside running the show. I guess the Residents haven’t been left out to fend for ourselves yet. This time around the bedside monitor was simply furious that the patient stopped breathing.
Pulseless electrical activity, PEA. The heart’s wires are firing but the pump isn’t working. You don’t lay on the paddles of a defibrillator for that either.
Hollywood has lied to you your whole life.
“Do you think we’re going to be able to resuscitate him?” “He’s full Code.” “But do you think
we’re going to be able
to resuscitate him?” “No, but…” “Right, so it doesn’t matter. We’re running the Code.”
I get my exercise for the day by pressing on the patient’s chest for a couple minutes.
“I don’t really want to intubate him.” The patient gets intubated anyway.
The respiratory therapist on my right (I think it's the RT, at least, everyone looks the same unders layers of PPE) gets a small spray of pink frothy fluid on her gown. Thank Christ for PPE.
A few people cycle through pushing on the patient’s chest. We haven’t felt a pulse since the Code began.
“How long has it been?” I suspect there’s a countdown timer in the intensivist’s brain that’s ticking towards an alarm labeled
Ok, We Tried
.
More compressions. Pretty sure I feel a rib break under my palms.
That
sensation never ceases to make me wince.
Another epi. Still no pulse.
The Doppler to check for a pulse is silent.
The timer goes off.
“That’s it.”
Time of death called.
…
Feels like COVID is eroding the edges off everyone’s soul in the hospital.
The initial novelty of sharp fear and apprehension standing outside COVID rooms before entering is giving way to a constant background dull dread as we gown up for the tenth or twentieth time that day.
I see my incredibly sharp attending boss distracted, needing to be reminded two or three times whose room he’s about to enter.
The lack of success in curing our patients is also taking its toll. “Successes” have mostly been defined as sending a patient home with personal oxygen tanks and explicit instructions on when to return if they get worse. We’ve had some milder cases that got sent home without oxygen, but they seem fewer than the number we send to get tubed.
I feel very bitter about this. It makes the sign out front, a sign that expresses nothing but pure gratitude and love, seem somehow mocking.

Day 10
""How many for you?"" ""Two."" ""Of twelve? Not so bad.""
​
88F w/PMH of HTN, prediabetes, Afib (on Coumadin) presented w/ a 3 day hx of progressive SoB, cough and subjective fevers. Found to be COVID-19 positive. Hospital course significant for clinical deterioration during stay requiring supplemental O2 via NRB. Repeat CXR 3/29/20 showed interval development of diffuse increased interstitial markings concerning for multifocal B/L PNA. Pt started on comfort measures but was found to be…
…
Let’s start over.
There once was a woman who lived a really long time. Let’s call her Ethel; she looks like an Ethel.
Like any octogenarian, Ethel had a few health issues, for which she took exactly seven pills each morning. It sounds like she lived a full life. We only really know that she was a NON-SMOKER and LIVES AT HOME. No one wrote down anything more than that in the box that’s supposed to summarize Ethel’s social life. She had a husband who was her emergency contact. There’s no box to check if they loved one another, but it’s probably a given that this theoretical box would house a neat little checkmark inside. She had at least one daughter, whose name probably could be found in a chart under ""Most Favorite Person in the World.""
Unlike other octogenarians, Ethel never visited the hospital. She saw doctors, sure (that was the price of growing old) but as far back as the computer can look, there’s no record of her ever setting foot inside the Emergency Room, up until ten days ago at least.
Ten days ago she came to the hospital because it was getting harder to breathe. She also had a fever and her muscles were always sore, but it was the huffing and puffing that scared her enough to head in. She got some oxygen and was given a room inside the hospital all to herself. She got that room because she had COVID – that virus which was causing the whole world to go crazy and her neighborhood to shut down. But the nurses were kind and the food wasn’t so bad. The oxygen helped her breathe. She was getting those drugs the President said would cure COVID. She probably liked the President. She sure liked to watch the News on TV.
On her third day in the hospital, a doctor came by and explained that since she needs a mask to breathe, if things got worse, the next step would have to be putting her to sleep and hooking her up to machines to keep her alive. Ethel didn’t want that. But her Most Favorite Person in the World would want her to FIGHT, so she reluctantly said she would be ok with a plastic tube down her throat. But the doctor said that this was Ethel’s choice, not her daughter’s, and it was an important one. He left the room so she could decide what to do.
The form she signed was bright pink. It had boxes on it that housed neat little checkmarks next to DO NOT REVIVE and DO NOT INTUBATE.
Ethel continued to take her medications and continued to breathe with a mask. Sometimes the very nice nurses would tell her to lie on her belly because it would help her breathe better. It was getting harder to breathe, even with the mask. Ethel thought the medications were making it harder to breathe, but believed once she completed the five days, she would start feeling better and could go home.
Those five days came and went. She wasn’t feeling better and could not go home. Another doctor came by and explained that her specialty was helping people feel better towards the end of their lives (which was only a possibility in her case, not something written in stone.) Ethel liked the morphine this other doctor gave her because it made it easier to breathe. Ethel did not like the anxiety pills this other doctor gave her because they made her drowsy.
One day the same doctor she saw right before signing the bright pink form came to visit her again. He said she was going to die. Ethel was very angry at this because she thought she was doing better. She said some things which in the bigger scheme of things aren’t that important. But really she just wanted the doctor to call her family to tell them what was going on.
Ethel got more and more morphine. She kept asking for it so often that the nice nurses put a machine in her room that gave her morphine around the clock.
Ethel couldn’t or maybe didn’t want to answer the doctor’s questions anymore.
Ethel was very tired during the day, so she mostly slept.
Ethel went to sleep one afternoon and didn’t wake up.

227 of 257 patients in the hospital are COVID positive. 41 COVIDS on ventilators. The ICU has expanded to the Cath lab. 1N and 3N have fallen, they're both COVID units now. I don't know how many ventilators we have left.
The passing of ""Ethel"" today marks the first patient formerly under my team’s care to be killed by COVID.

“…unless it’s ’visibly soiled.’ Like we could

Corona.”
​
I’ve been known to flirt with the LD50 of caffeine, but this morning I’m slipping it some tongue.
I’m status post two pieces of 100mg caffeine gum and a cup of coffee by 6:30AM. I hit 70 on the back roads heading towards the hospital in the minutes just after sunrise. There are practically no other cars around. My AirPods stream Andrew W.K.’s “Ready to Die.” A tasteless choice, sure, but it fits the energy of the day so far.
The 73M with multiple comorbidities who developed an NSTEMI, and who tested positive for COVID 4 days after testing negative has steadily been declining in the SICU. He’s refusing his medications despite his seasoned ICU nurse using the full spectrum of asking, demanding, and sternly admonishing him on his nonadherence. She even broke out the fake tears, she told me. She doesn’t do that for everyone. But no dice.
More importantly he’s doing poorly on a nonrebreather (NRB). If he takes the mask off, his sats drop to the 70s, a value you might guess correctly to be incompatible with life. He’s a little altered and he’s been put on dilaudid and a wrist restraint. Just the one, a CVA left the left arm safely useless.
One of the interns asks me what the plan was for our patient here.
“Palliative has a Goals of Care meeting with his family today. Our only plan is to keep him alive long enough for them to sign the DNI/DNR.”
I can blame the caffeine, I can justify it by saying his prognosis was
dire
and it’s reasonable to think we did all we could, but I scare myself a little with how low my empathy’s dimmer switch is set.
But I don’t know how else to deal with this. The recommended treatment guidelines changed, yet again. Azithromycin is now actively
counter
-indicted for COVID patients. We take him off it. Steroids, which as of yesterday were counter-indicated for COVID are now the standard of treatment for all patients on NRB. We start him on Solu-Medrol 1.5mg/kg divided BID. For all the good that will do.
He’s also well past the 5 days of Plaquenil / hydroxychloroquine. You know, that drug that was supposed to solve this whole crisis?
We all remember that right? I’ve got photographic proof we used to believe it would work.
Take a look at the March 17th (or Day -5, if you’d like)
National Enquirer
cover:
CORONAVIRUS
CURES

FOUND!
Warning! Surgical masks
SPREAD INFECTION!
Take a look at
every single intubated patient’s
medical orders and you’ll see they either completed or are on Plaquenil and azithromycin.
And people
still
think we have any handle on this other than jamming tubes down throats and waiting.
No one will believe the history of this thing when it’s over.
The patient passed that afternoon.
His daughters had signed a DNI/DNR right before.
…
I’m reminded of an intro Stephen King wrote for one of his books, where he writes about fear:
""The shape is there, and most of us come to realize what it is sooner or later: it is the shape of a body under a sheet. All our fears add up to one great fear, all our fears are part of that great fear - an arm, a leg, a finger, an ear. We're afraid of the body under the sheet. It's our body.…And [the writer] takes your hand and he enfolds it in his own and he takes you into the room and he puts your hands on the shape under the sheet… and he tells you to touch it here… here… and
here*…""*
A quarter million Americans (
at least
) are going to become bodies under sheets in the span of one or two months. And we’re talking about returning to work and a “miracle” ending to this in nine days.
Wake up and feel the corpses.
(PS: Yes, I owe Stephen King a royalty check given how much I crib his writing style.
)

​
Day 12
“I will continue using military metaphors. We are at war with this virus.”
​
The greetings this morning were grim.
“Stay safe” has become the
aloha
of intra-Resident conversations. I heard that twice before reaching the front doors of the hospital by 6:50AM.
“How was the night?” is the standard greeting to the two Residents just finishing their 12 hour Night Float shift. These are the two young MDs left to put out fires across half the hospital’s two hundred or so non-ICU beds.
“We had the longest Code ever. Took an hour. We went through maybe 20 epi’s.”
Epinephrine is only given to people with either pulseless electrical activity or those who are asystolic – flatliners. (Once again, Hollywood has lied to you. You don’t put the paddles on anyone with a monitor next to them going
BEEEEEEEEEEEEEP
.) The ACLS guidelines say you push epi every 3-5 minutes.
The
Ok, We Tried
alarm should have gone off about 3-4 epi’s in. Not 20.
“Was it a young guy?” “No, It was John.”
I curse a little louder than I mean to. I walk out of the room and wash my hands even though I’m sure I hadn’t touched anything.
John is-
was
a nurse at my hospital. He
was
maybe in his early 50s. Every Resident loved him because he was tough and always fought for his patients. He was a nice guy and a pleasure to work with. But he was fierce. He’d seek us out during Rounds, stare us down and make sure we put in orders for his patients ASAP. We all respected him.
I knew he was on a vent as of the night before with settings that looked, well,
dire
, but it’s still a shock.
The night team leaves. I start mindlessly updating the cheat sheet summary of our 16 patients. I’m on autopilot at this point. 13 are COVID cases. COVID cases are, unfortunately, very easy to manage. You put in orders for medications that you’re pretty sure don’t work, you note how bad their oxygen saturation is on nasal cannula (NC) or nonrebreather (NRB), and you gown up and see the worst cases / people you think might need to be intubated in the near future.
The first Rapid Response comes at 7:40AM. I reach the door (of course it’s a COVID room, that’s all we have left) and realize I left my N95 at home. I’m not entering that room. I flippantly tell the interns to assess the situation and head to pick up a new mask at the Command Center.
The nice nursing admin lady hands me a paper bag with a new N95. She tells me to sign for it in the binder just outside the door. Despite my autopilot brain, I joke, “Oh we’re on the honor system? You know I’m just going to sign ‘John Smith’ in the binder right?” She laughs and says it’s ok I left my N95 at home.
I take my mask and sign John Smith in the binder.
Just because I’m in shock doesn’t mean I can pass up a joke like that.
I head back up to the Rapid. I get a debrief that this was narrow complex ventricular tachycardia in the 200s. They pushed metoprolol (wrong decision) and adenosine (right decision). I go talk to the very bright and hardworking intern on my team. I explain that in situations like this where the patient is otherwise hemodynamically stable, metoprolol isn’t going to do enough to slow the heart rate. You’ve got to reset the circuit breaker. I asked who the attending was in the room.
There was no attending. The intern had to make the call.
I left my interns to the wolves when I walked off in a huff to go get a new mask.
My autopilot brain goes over how shitty I am of a senior Resident.
When YOU were an intern, at least your seniors never walked away from a Rapid.
As I walk back to the call room to barricade myself behind a door for an hour or so, I come upon a nurses meeting where the news of John’s passing was being announced. I honestly don’t remember a single word of it. I do remember the occasional sobs coming from these amazing women.
Then there’s a Rapid and a COVID is intubated.
Table Rounds.
Then there’s a Rapid and a COVID is intubated.
I’m getting good at assessing whether or not a hypoxic COVID patient will get tubed and if we have time to get them upstairs before they crash.
Go me.
…
“The world breaks everyone and afterward many are strong at the broken places.”
I worry that some of my fellow Residents will break in the near-future.
It wouldn’t be a big break, just a small one that makes you sob on the way to work and dread every new day. For what it’s worth, so long as no one in the residency program gets sick, I don’t think I’ll break. A few of us are close though.
It‘s the Night Float’s birthday today. Which means she technically coded John for 60 minutes on her birthday in the pre-dawn hours. When she tells me this, we tell social distancing to go fuck itself and hug for a while. I offer to take her shift and work a 24, but she declines.
The possibility, the
comfort
of breaking feels like it’s hiding just over the horizon waiting for us.
It’s what follows that Hemmingway quote which worries me.
“But those that will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially. If you are none of these you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry.”
John never broke.
He was good, and gentle and brave. And he was killed.
​
​
Day 13
“Where do you want dad to die? Paralyzed on a ventilator or not?”
​
Quiet day. Got time to take stock of everything.
The hospital is housing somewhere around 250 patients including the regular floors and the Empire of the ICU, >90% positive COVID. My team’s census for tomorrow is 100% COVID. There’s talk about transferring the few remaining COVID-negatives to the USNS Comfort.
Oh, and yesterday some moron tried to crash a train into the USNC Mercy on the West coast. Because we’re dumb, panicky animals.
45 COVID cases on vents with a dozen or so vents available. A little over 60 people currently on nonrebreathers.
We're still 5 days from peak hospitalizations and 6 days from peak fatalities per day.
Personally, I think I’m holding up as well as I can. Writing has helped. Occasionally get some exercise in. Plan on going for a long walk tonight.
I’ve got 6 more days of scheduled inpatient care left. Two weeks of vacation after that. I’m thinking about signing up to do COVID swabbing since it pays well and I’d go nuts if I weren’t doing something.
I still hate the idea of treating this as a war, but I’m thinking about volunteering to be “redeployed” to another hospital elsewhere in the States once New York gets past this. The rest of the country is only a week or so behind. New fronts are opening up. I’m pretty well experienced in managing COVID cases at this point.
…
Feels like I’m living in the time between a flash of lightning and the roll of thunder.",

“Alright we’re done.”
​
I wonder when we’ll need a refrigerated corpse truck trailer.
Before my shift officially starts, at 6:50AM, a Code Blue is called. 90F w/ dementia and probably a long list of other comorbidities is found essentially cold and dead when the day shift nurse first walks in the room at the beginning of her shift.
Because mankind is cruel and irrational, this lady whose last real conscious thought occurred several years to a decade ago is still Full Code. So half a dozen nurses and four doctors all gown up and rush into her room to break her ribs before she's officially pronounced dead.
Because we're doing
everything to save her
, don't you see.
I swear to Christ I'm not this heartless when I'm the outpatient Family Med doctor I was supposed to be.
By the time I find a gown (a lovely, blue plastic trash bag of a gown which makes me sweat profusely and leaves my back slick with sweat and my gloves full of sweat and I pray we get those breathable yellow paper gowns again) then put on my eye protection and gloves and enter the room, the attending is already calling it quits.
The anesthesiologist asks if this patient (
this corpse
) needs intubation.
“If you want to intubate her that’s fine. If you want to put yourself through it.”
One push of epi.
There's no blood pressure, pulse was gone well before we got to work.
Time of death… who knows.
Does it matter?
…
I come back to my call room and look at the census. 22 patients, 100% COVID.
I scroll a third the way down the cheat sheet and see EXPIRED. At this point that just means alerting the attending of more paperwork to be done.
I round on all my patients. They're all miserable, can't catch their breath and have headaches. A very nice lady asks that if she and her husband are in the hospital, should her 90 year old mother who lives with them be afraid? The truth is if you flip a coin she's already infected. If she's symptomatic and needs to go to the hospital, she's got a good 1 in 5 chance of dying.
I neglect to tell her those odds. I tell my patient to call her mom, and that she should report any symptoms to her regular PCP.
Then there’s a Rapid and a COVID is intubated.
He was a younger guy, only in his 60s. He's got a chance.
Then table rounds.
Then there’s a Rapid and a COVID… isn't intubated.
88M w/ dementia plus many other things. He'd never make it off the tube.
We're here now. We're running low on beds and ventilators and the Tough Decisions are being made.
The
guidelines
the dictates of the Gods of the Empire of the ICU as of a few days ago were a patient could only be intubated if they were A) satting <90%, B) tachypneic >30RR, and C) prone when these were taken.
Now we're adding on if they've lived a life well into their 80s or if they've got dementia or if through ""clinical judgement"" you know they're hosed, then they won't be tubed.
It makes total sense.
I've had a few calls now where I've gone through the pre-written script for letting the typical patient's spouse of decades and decades know their world is about to end. How that soul they've nuzzled up against for comfort is close to depart since death is inevitable.
""Not a candidate for invasive intervention"" is the exact phrase.
Rationing? Cold calculation in an unprecedented time of suffering?
Truthfully, I'm thankful I’m not making these decisions.

​
Day 16
“Basically they wanted me to lie to the family. Say ‘we did everything we could.’ But we didn’t.”
​
This is when things start getting bad.
Did I feel it when I walked in today? The shift in the air?
One of our patients, a lady in her 80s, has been steadily degrading, gasping for air on a nonrebreather for close to two weeks. Palliative was brought on board yesterday.
Palliative calls the patient’s husband. It’s documented right there in the chart: “Pt has living will expressing no aggressive measures including CPR and Intubation however her husband appointed HCP does not want to place limits. Call placed to pt's husband for follow up. He is unwilling to talk further than ‘I want my wife home.’”
Overnight, the patient remained febrile, 102.7F despite Tylenol and cold packs. Hypotensive, 50/20s. Agonal breathing. It’s a sight you won’t forget after you’ve seen it. The clinical definition is disturbing enough:
“…characterized by gasping, labored breathing, accompanied by strange vocalizations and myoclonus.”
ICU evaluates her and says she’s not a candidate for pressers, intubation, or CPR. But still, no DNI/DNR order is placed.
The Night Float calls the patient’s husband. He remains adamant that he “wants everything done.” Night Float is essentially told by the Emissary of the ICU to not even enter the room should she Code, then call up the husband and reassure him we tried our best.
There’s a piece of me that empathizes with the patient’s husband. He’s been married to her for who knows how long. He was probably terrified, in denial, and isolated.
But a bigger piece of me thinks he’s a
fucking monster
for extending his wife’s suffering explicitly against her prior wishes.
At 09:19, we get a call that she has stopped breathing. Code Blue goes off.
The nurse at the door says something about how she knows it’s futile but she didn’t feel right not calling the Code. Because FULL CODE and DOING EVERYTHING TO SAVE THEM is sacred. Or it was. Or something. I don’t know anymore.
I tell everyone the plan. “Two people and two people only in the room.” I point at my interns. “Stay outside.”
I put on my gown and gloves. Did I put on the stylish lab glasses I wear around my collar as an apocalyptic-chic fashion statement? No, I remember now. I kept my regular glasses on instead. Because a good 30 seconds into breaking this woman’s ribs someone else entered the room and put a plastic shield over my face.
But before that I asked for a backboard under the patient. She was wide eyed and dead but I still asked for it.
And before that I pointed at the clock and said, “In five minutes, at 9:26, we’re stopping the Code.”
I’m pretty sure I felt ribs pop in succession like a zipper when I started compressions.
I think it was only two or three minutes into the Code before the intensivist walked into the room. He asked the patient’s age (82) and if she had dementia (she did) and after learning so told us to stop immediately.
Time of death… who knows.
Does it matter?
…
I leave the room without making eye contact with anyone. I try to remain cognizant of my hands and the right way to take off my PPE without buying a metaphorical scratcher ticket for the slight chance of intubation or death.
My poker face must suck because I’m asked three times in a walk of 300 feet if I’m ok. (Not even poker face. It’s all covered with a mask. My eyes are giving me away.) A nurse, the Chief Medical Officer of the entire hospital, and the Medical Director of the entire hospital. They all ask if I’m ok. I’m not, but I lie.
I tell the truth to my patients and I lie to my colleagues and bosses.
The nurse who called the Code in the first place asks me if I’m ok as I’m walking out of (fleeing from) the unit. “Thank you, doctor. Thank you.” I can’t summon any words to respond.
Thank me for what?
is the only thought I have.
The Chief Medical Officer stops me and asks me if I’m ok tells me we’re going to have a meeting sometime today to discuss end of life issues.
The Medical Director asks me if I’m ok and sees right through me. He does his best to boost my morale.
He knows I’m a big fan of the food being offered to the Heroes of the Hospital (
I assure you I bitterly laughed while writing that
) and insists I go get some food. I half-heartedly say I had a piece of a donated heart-shaped Danish earlier, but he goes out of his way to physically walk me over to the Command Center where some breakfast burritos were delivered.
I appreciate this gesture so much. I’m just a little ashamed he had to spend time on me when he’s dealing with quite literal life and death decisions on an hourly basis.
I soft coded a patient and got a breakfast burrito for the trouble.
Go me.
I soft coded a patient.
I was protecting my team and the nurses and it didn’t matter if we put on pacer pads not or if we even tried epi and she was dead when I walked in the room.
Just please forgive me.",

I was facing a 5000 legal deposit, 'just to start' and facing months of stress dealing with the situation.   All the govt agencies I tried referred me to someone else. Instead I decided to walk away.

The AAP's official position has simply been ""tell your patients to shop around and don't consider any alternatives,"" which is literally useless. The current nutritional guidelines are heavily influenced by formula manufacturers and the milk lobby and I wish the AAP would seize this opportunity to break their grip.
Like many of the medical professionals on this forum I am seeing desperate parents (both at work and socially) who are struggling to feed their infants, and I wanted to take a minute to put my advice in writing. Maybe you guys will find it useful too. So here is the advice I am giving my patients, as a board certified pediatrician and as a father of two.
This advice applies to healthy infants, and will not be appropriate for significantly premature babies (born less than 36 weeks gestation) or infants with heart, kidney, liver, intestinal, digestive, or allergic diseases. If you are going to deviate from the AAP’s recommendations, have a chat with your pediatrician too and make sure that they agree with me, and that this plan is suitable for
your
baby.
Under 4 months
, infants need breastmilk or
infant
formula. There really is no safe substitute, and formula distribution should prioritize these babies.  If you cannot get your usual formula, consider some options:
A different infant formula. The difference between brands, or cow’s milk-based vs soy-based vs other plant-based infant formula are negligible and you can use any of them with confidence.
Hydrolyzed and amino acid formulas, while expensive and designed for babies with certain digestive issues, are nutritionally complete and are safe to give to healthy infants. They smell awful but babies don’t care.
Infant formula for premature babies is a little more calorie dense and contains a little more protein than stanard infant formula, but will do in a pinch.
European, Canadian, or UK infant formulas are great. Be sure to read the mixing instructions, as they often have a different scoop-to-water ratio than US formulas. If you are importing these, be sure that it is from a source you trust.
Breastfeeding mothers might want to
try increasing their supply.
This is easier said than done. Remember that US law requires your employer
give you time to express milk and a private space that is not a bathroom each time you need to pump
. This is one of the few areas of maternal-infant health in which US law doesn’t completely suck.
The following are
NOT
safe alternatives
Home made formula. Will likely have the wrong balance of macronutrients but will certainly lack important micronutrients. Often has a dangerously different osmolality. Infants eat whatever they are given and have dumb kidneys, so are prone to hyponatremia or hypernatremia and every pediatrician has seen a baby die this way. Don’t do it.
Diluting infant formula in insanely dangerous. Do not do this under any circumstances.
Toddler formulas (marketed for infants >12 months old), have more calories per ounce than infant formula and consequently a “meal” with toddler formula will contain less free water. In an infant this will cause constipation and hypernatremia/dehydration. I suppose if you had literally nothing else to give, but this is not a long-term solution, or even a week-long solution.
Between 4 and 6 months
, infants will still need some infant formula, but you have some options.
Solid food. You
should be starting solid foods at 4 months
, (
the AAP says 6 months
, but they are wrong). It is unlikely that solid food will make up a meaningful proportion of your baby’s diet until closer to 6 months, but you can start practicing with some rice or oatmeal cereal at 4 months. This is also a great opportunity to introduce allergens like peanut, egg, shellfish, tree nuts, and so on - the earlier they are introduced the less likely you are to develop an allergy. There are various products
like SpoonfulOne
that contain small amounts of the 16 most common allergens which you can mix into your 4 month old’s cereal.
Toddler formulas may be more calorically dense (and, consequently, have less free water) and still aren't ideal but it terrifies me less at this age. Not safe for long-term use but could get you through a weekend.
Between 6 and 9 months
you can really ramp up food+water (and consequently decrease your reliance on formula). The infant now has distinct hunger and thirst mechanisms so it will appropriately choose between food and water when hungry or thirsty. This means you could offer one bottle of toddler formula and a small amount of plain water and trust the baby to balance its calories vs fluid. But it also means that you can feed the baby a meaningful amount of food. By 9 months old I like my patients to be getting the large majority of their nutrition from food.
It is worth being familiar with
the macronutritional requirements of infants,
because they are pretty different than a typical American adult's diet. Total calories vary by sex/weight, but is typically around 600-800 calories/day. I encourage parents to be flexible with this, and you will see a normal infant's appetite vary hugely day to day or week to week. As long as you are offering good foods, just feed to satiation and don't sweat the details.
That said, here are the details. Daily intake (food+formula) at this age should include:
90-100 grams per day of carbohydrates
10-15 grams per day of protein
30 grams per day of fat taking special care to including a source of essential fatty acids including Linoleic acid and Arachidonic acid (5g/day) and α-Linolenic acid and Docosahexaenoic acid (0.5 g/day). You will find these in eggs, fish, olive oil, and cheese
There are a lot of micronutrient requirements but the simplest way to meet them is to use
a fortified grain cereal as your base
and mix in various pureed things. If you don't want to use a fortified cereal for some reason, take care to ensure that your baby is getting 1 mg/kg/day of iron and 400 IU/day of vitamin D. You will probably need supplements to achieve this.
Don't hold back on the variety of food. Vegetables, meat, fruit, seafood, nuts, everything. If the food is safe for you, it is safe for the baby (except honey - no honey until 12 months). Explore strong flavors and a variety of textures. Be mindful of choking hazards (peanuts, small grapes, etc). Finger foods are fun and great for motor skills, but your infant will not consume many calories on finger foods alone.
After 9 months
just feed food. If you are struggling to meet the fat requirements above, you can give some cow's milk. Infant formula is convenient but absolutely unnecessary at this age.
After 12 months
, baring a failure to thrive situation or a family that is hopeless at providing nutritious food, I actively discourage liquid calories. Children should eat food.
Common mistakes
to be aware of at all ages:
Goat's milk contains very little folate and its use as a primary calorie source causes megaloblastic anemia.
Cow's milk over 32 ounces per day impairs iron absorption and causes iron deficiency anemia
even if the diet contains otherwise adequate iron
. In children this is a hypercoagulable state and can cause cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. I have see this.
Plant ""milk"" (almond, oat, etc) is never appropriate for babies. Even the best of them have 50% the calories of human or cow milk, and 20% of the protein and fat.  Do not use. Plant-based infant formulas have added protein/fat and
are
safe.",
Medicine,https://old.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/k9ep2a/anonymous_writings_of_a_covid_nurse/,2345,149,Anonymous writings of a covid nurse,"“You a nurse?”
I glance up from my phone and look at the young man before me, dressed in a rumpled blue Kroger apron and khakis. He’s maybe seventeen, possibly a little older. It’s hard to tell these days with everybody wearing a mask. We’re left to judge those around us based on their eyes and build alone. The enthusiastic, carefree manner with which he’d been jabbering at the bagger next to him before he turned his attention to me gives him away far more than what I could glean from his appearance.
“I am,” I answer. I’m coming straight from work, still dressed in my navy blue jumpsuit and the classic black departmentally-approved jacket that has my name and hospital logo emblazoned on the chest. I’m hungry, exhausted, and sore. I just spent thirteen hours getting my ass kicked in full PPE. There’s
at least
a stage two pressure ulcer behind my ears that stings perpetually, serving as a constant reminder of the year we’re living through. On a normal day, I’d probably enjoy this little social back and forth. On a normal day, I’d love meaningless pleasantries like chit-chatting about my job. But right now, I’m just looking to score some stale fried chicken from the freshly closed hotline before I sink wordlessly into a scalding bath with a glass of wine.
His eyes light up. I can almost sense it coming.
“What’s the worst thing you’ve ever seen?”
I might feel offended if there was anything left in me capable of feeling. It’s a rude enough question to ask in its own right, but it’s especially awful timing during 2020. My colleagues and I are in the middle of a war. Or maybe it’s a genocide. Somedays it feels like the unending tide of patients will never stop, mounting higher and higher until the collective crush of humanity finally stresses us to our breaking points. Mothers, fathers, grandparents, uncles, daughters. They fill our beds up regardless of whoever they are to whoever brought them in. And yet the rest of the world keeps on spinning merrily along, intentionally oblivious. Throwing birthday parties, traveling to the beach, celebrating 12th anniversaries over steaks and bloomin’ onions at Outback.
What actually
is
the worst thing I’ve ever seen, I wonder? Despite the numerous times I’ve fielded this query, I’ve never truly stopped to think about it before. A number of situations spring to mind immediately, but they’re all oddly blurry through the lens of distant recollection. I can’t picture faces. I can’t remember names. Truth is, this young kid in front of me might have been on my assignment yesterday for all that I know. Once the time clock gives its telltale chirp that my badge swipe has been registered, I dump everything in my locker and leave…including memories. It’s just the nature of the gig. Very few individuals ever sneak their way into my synaptic clefts and set up permanent residence.
But today? Today is different.
This is one of the shifts that’s made a rare impression on me, like pushing your thumb into a memory foam mattress. I’m left with a little divot in my psyche. Even now, standing before the plexiglass barrier in this dumpy Kroger with the lackluster produce section, I can mentally feel that little hollow and know that somebody has moved in. No vacancies today, I’m afraid.
I had a full line of folks today, but only one of them was riding my nerves. Old guy. Not that it matters in my opinion. Nobody deserves to die like that regardless of age. Covid, of course. What else is there to treat these days?
He’d picked it up from his daughter, I guess. Contact tracing is mostly an exercise in futility at this stage. It doesn’t matter, anyway. The moment I laid eyes on him at shift change I knew that he was a dead man. It was written all over him in a language that every single healthcare worker is fluent in. The head-bob with every inspiration. The way his collarbones and ribs became prominent as he gulped for breath like a man drowning in nothing. The faint sound of crackles, like cellophane being crushed between your fingers. The restless picking at his covers, his gown, his oxygen mask, clawing them all off with whatever strength he could muster. For whatever reason, most people prefer to exit the world they way they entered it; clothed in nothing, helpless to the elements.
I replaced his oxygen mask and ignored the blaring saturation alarm desperately attempting to alert me to the fact that he was in danger. He was already on 100% oxygen. He’d long since finished his round of remdesivir and convalescent plasma, for all the good they’re worth. Short of forcing pure O2 into his lungs with a pressurized noninvasive ventilation system, there was nothing else to be done. He’d never tolerate a BiPap anyway. He’d have it yanked off in a New York minute and I’d be left scrambling in the hallway to get geared up and put it back on before he coded. If his family wanted him to be full care, I was going to have to tie his arms to his bed. Even then, it was blatantly apparent that he wasn’t going to survive. He would die alone, fighting in restraints, suffocating slowly until his light was snuffed out by a strand of RNA a mere 70 nanometers in diameter.
I paged his attending and told him that it was time for The Talk. You know the one. The one where we admit defeat. Throw in the towel. The one where we switch gears from healing somebody to ensuring that they’re dying well. “Okay,” he replied with a sigh. “I’ll give them a call. Watch for orders and you’ll know which way it went.”
It didn’t go the way I expected, but it did go the way I hoped. I breathed a sigh of relief when I saw orders for morphine, ativan, and discontinuation of telemetry monitoring instead of serial ABGs, BiPap settings, and a stat chest xray. His futile fight was over. He would be allowed to exit stage left with a set of unbroken ribs, no tube expertly placed by a far-too practiced hand into his throat and threaded down until it reached his ruined lungs.
He finally went unresponsive and entered the actively dying phase about halfway through my shift, but I had the tools at my disposal to keep him comfortable. I pointed a fan straight at his face and turned it on high in the hopes that his brain would mistake the wind for breath. When he became air hungry, I had medications in my arsenal to keep him satiated. When he became anxious like a cornered animal, I had the tools to keep him calm. I turned the lights low. I brought in an LED candle and placed it on his bedside table. I pulled a chair next to him, held his hand, called his family and asked them what kind of music he liked to listen to. Old country, came the answer. Even though it was an exposure risk for me, I pulled out my phone and put my Spotify Premium account to good use. He won’t die alone, I promised them. I’ll be here. They thanked me for my kindness, my care, my compassion. They feel better knowing he’s in my hands, they say.
If only they knew that what
I
feel is nothing.
That's not a normal human reaction. It’s monstrous.
I’m
monstrous.
Who watches somebody die horrifically, far away from the people who love them, residing under every single isolation precaution we’ve ever developed a protocol for and has no emotional reaction at all? Who numbly performs empathetic actions solely out of the formulaic knowledge that it's the socially correct thing to do? What kind of nurse operates like this, anyway? We’re supposed to be the shining pillar of solicitude. We wrote the book on warmth and care. But, whatever a good nurse is supposed to be, I’m the antithesis of it now.
I'm an android masquerading as a normal person. I'm the Borg. A Geth unit. I feel like a computer crunching numbers on a spreadsheet, only the numbers are other creatures and I'm pretending to feel alive like them. Most days I’m thankful for the masks more for the physical distance it places between me and other people than the physical protection from illness. At least they can’t tell that what I’m demonstrating isn’t noble stoicism, but numbness.
Maybe this is self defensive. Maybe it's a trauma response. Maybe it'll all come back to me in a flood one day when this is all over and it'll bring me to my knees. Or maybe I'm just fundamentally broken as a person by everything I’ve witnessed this year. Maybe this is permanent.
I do recall that I used to feel. I used to cry with my patients when they received bad news, or genuinely cheer with them when they received good results. I used to celebrate every discharge as a small victorious moment in their lives and my career. I wasn’t always like this. I regret that I’m like this now, and yet I don’t know if I would change it even if I had the ability to do so.
I watched a man die today and felt nothing. And
that
, I think, is the worst thing I’ve ever seen.
But this kid doesn’t actually want to hear that. He doesn’t want to know the real stuff. He wants to be regaled with a glory tale. A story about how I once coded somebody and they farted with every chest compression. A quippy anecdote about some guy that “fell” on a cucumber that somehow mysteriously ended up in his rectal vault. It’s socially inappropriate to be honest and I don’t really care to be honest anyway. So I pause for a second before deciding what to say.
“Eloesser flap care,” I reply. “Had to pack a guy’s chest cavity twice a day with 26 yards of gauze. Every time I pulled the packing out it was like that old magic trick with scarves.”
He grimaces and laughs as his mask slips below his nose. He doesn’t bother to replace it. I don’t bother to remind him, because it changes nothing anyway. He has no perspective on what it’s like inside the halls of my hospital. He’s young and careless, even though he’s taken seventeen thousand selfies of himself in a mask to prove how conscious he is to Instagram. It’s just his nose anyway. Even if he gets it he’ll be fine, he thinks. And most likely, he’s correct.
It’s the nurse in front of him that isn’t fine.
I grab my bag of lukewarm chicken and leave. Clock’s ticking, afterall. I’ve got an alarm set on my phone for five AM so I can get up before the crack of dawn and do it all again.",

They cry. And they tell me they didn't know. They thought it was a  hoax. They thought it was political. They thought because they had a  certain blood type or a certain skin color they wouldn't get as sick.  They thought it was 'just the flu'.
But they were wrong. And they wish  they could go back. But they can't. So they thank me and they go get the  vaccine. And I go back to my office, write their death note, and say a  small prayer that this loss will save more lives.""

Most people that died of cancer likely had other underlying health conditions like COPD, heart disease, diabetes etc.
And since most of the people who died of cancer were very old, then they were already gonna die sooner or later, so it's not that much of a tragedy
Very few death certificates had cancer as the only thing written on it so obviously the death toll for cancer is massively exaggerated.
Speaking about death certificates, I know someone who had cancer but died after a car crash, and they listed cancer as a cause of death.
And how dare the government impose on my freedoms by banning smoking in public places or taxing sugary foods.
And all the measures that the government put in to prevent cancer like regulations for sugar, tobacco and screening programs are a massive dent in the economy.
Also have you seen how harmful the drugs that doctors give for cancer are? They are so expensive as well so I bet they're just given to line the pockets of big-pharma, I'll stick to my homemade orange juice.
And finally places like Africa put relatively little money into cancer research yet much less people die of cancer, so obviously all the measures we're doing are not working.

Details the case of an NP in Texas who was promoting himself as an endocrinologist, and killed two patients, injuring many others.
The outline:
KM was the graduate of an online NP school. Soon after graduation, he opened his own hormone clinic. Texas is a supervised state, his supervisor was a surgeon 140 miles away, who had no knowledge of what he was doing.
Amy Townsend, MD is a local physician who became aware of what he was doing because a friend went to KM for a refill of his synthroid. KM ordered 63 lab tests before even seeing the patient. His testosterone was normal, but he was given IM testosterone anyway. Dr. Townsend was aware of another patient of this clinic who had died at age 45 of an MI after large doses of testosterone. And then another death came to light. She made a formal complaint to the Board of Nursing. During this process, she found he had 13 other complaints lodged against him pending. The BON did nothing for many months, KM continued his practice unchanged. Dr. Townsend finally demanded to meet the BON in person, and drove 5 hours to do so. In the meeting they said they didn't have anyone with enough expertise to judge him. Dr. Townsend herself found an endocrinologist to review his practices, the BON did not extend themselves to do this. Over a year later, his license was removed.
What to learn from this:
1) there are NPs practicing with little training who will hurt people (The
EliteNursePractitioner.com
will even help NPs set up such practices. THey have a video course on endocrinology that the NP can buy, and they offer advice on the business aspects. THey will help the NP find a supervisor who wont' bother them.
2) Ethical NPs, RNs and Physicians are the only protection for patients, We can recognize this and take steps. Patients and other laypeople cannot.
3) Doing the right thing, as Dr. Townsend did, can be hard. And exhausting. But, we know what the right thing to do is. I would be pretty sure Dr. Townsend saved some lives.",

Hey all. Wasn't sure where to post this, but
/r/medicine
seemed the most appropriate.
I'm a new anesthesiologist at a community hospital. We have not been crushed by COVID yet, but we're moving in that direction, and every day we're teetering on the precipice of at or beyond capacity. The policy in our shop is to have anesthesia do all COVID intubations if at all possible and there haven't been a ton of them to do so far, but we had a somewhat unexpected bolus today and I had a handful. Now, I'm usually pretty unflappable and can take a lot of stuff--I think a lot of us are, or were, before COVID--but one of the patients today really hit me hard.
He's an 80 year old with multiple comorbidities who's been steadily declining on increasing non-invasive ventilatory support. The ICU called us somewhat non-emergently understanding that the patient was definitely heading that direction. I go over there with a CRNA for extra hands, we PPE up, and start the preparations. The ICU doc is in there with us and does the procedural time out while we're setting up, but before we can get started the patient gestures around his hissing BiPAP for something to write with. He tries to say what he wants to say a couple of times, but the BiPAP is too loud and he just can't muster enough air to speak up over it. There's a bit of a scramble for pen and paper, and he just starts writing what we think are random words. One of the nurses pipes up and says, ""I think those are song names"", and the patient nods. Then he writes ""funeral"".
He was desperately scribbling the songs he wanted played at his funeral. He knew that he is likely to get worse, and that he may die--he explicitly told the ICU to keep him on the vent no more than a week, and told his family to hold them to it. He knew that this could be the last time his eyes close.
Then we intubated him and lined him up and went on to do the next one.
I don't think there is a way we go ""back to normal"" after all of this. There will simply be before COVID and after COVID.",

35M w/PMH of depression presents w/ a 19 day hx of going through hell. Found to be broken by COVID-19. Hospital course significant for bearing witness to many, many pts intubated and/or expired. Believes he brought comfort / humanity to some of his pts (results pending). Repeat rereading of his own story scared him. He started himself on comfort measures at home but was found to be…
...
Let's start over.
There once was a guy who lived for a fair amount of time but was still relatively pretty new at it, all things considered. Let's call him Danny; he looks like a Danny.
Like any guy with a couple letters after his name, Danny had a few issues with healthcare, which he fought each morning. And afternoon. And evening. And when he came home. It sounds like he lived a full(ish) life. We only really know that he is a DOCTOR and LIVES AT HOME. At least when he's not spending the majority of his waking hours in a hospital. He wrote a few things in the box that's supposed to summarize Danny's social life. He really should have written more in it though, since his friends and family have kept him somewhat happy while he's going through hell. He had a wife who is his emergency contact but who left him two days short of three months ago. There’s no box to check if they loved one another, but it’s probably a given that this theoretical box used to house a neat little checkmark inside. It used to at least. He didn't have any kids despite really wanting them, which hurt her and was one of the reasons the neat little checkmark went away. It really hurts when he looks at his chart under ""Most Favorite Person in the World.""
Unlike other physicians, Danny never got used to people being sick, despite his whole working-at-a-hospital thing. He saw sick people sometimes, sure (that was the price of being a doctor) but as far back as 21 days ago he never saw anything like this.
Twenty-one days ago he came to the hospital because he was scheduled to be the senior resident. He wasn't really sure he could do a good job at it, and the whole COVID plague really scared him. He got a whole room to himself to write his worries out and the history of each day. He barricaded himself in that room for hours and hours (when he wasn't responding to Rapids or Code Blues or talking to sick patients) because COVID took over his hospital. He prescribed the drugs he was told to by his bosses and listened to the President proclaim everything would be ok. He sure loathed seeing that orange fucking prick on TV.
On his third day in the hospital, he tried to do the right thing and limit suffering and protect the people around him. He offered his patient CHOICE and told the truth, even if afterwards it made him think he was a terrible person.
Danny continued to prescribe medications and continued to try to be a good person. Sometimes he'd joke around with the very nice nurses and it helped him breathe better. Danny wasn't sure the medications were doing any good, but he was doing what smarter people well above him recommended. And he wasn't God, you know, despite his Messiah Complex.
One day Danny came home after three weeks of working 7AM-7PM Sunday through Friday. But he took off the last day he was scheduled to be in the clinic because he couldn't take it anymore. He needed a break. And that was ok. Because he did break.
Luckily he had two weeks of scheduled vacation time starting the day after. And he wasn't going to volunteer to head back into hell.
Danny didn't do much of anything in particular. He watched
Some Good News with John Krasinski
which made him smile, he played
Stellaris
while listening to
Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend
which made him guffaw.
Danny finished off the last pieces of donated food to the Heroes of the Hospital he had smuggled home.
He still didn’t think he was a hero, but that's ok too.
Danny hung out with his friends and gave spontaneous piggyback rides and laughed a lot even if he sorta fell straight on his face and got a small laceration to his left eyebrow. Which made him laugh harder. It was his Least Favorite Eyebrow, anyway, so who cares?
Does it matter?
Danny didn't have to answer anyone's questions and stopped chart stalking the people he was taking care of. Because he finally realized he did his time.
And maybe did some good during that time.
Danny wrote some more one afternoon and it made him happy.
…
…
Maybe there's a book I could finish about this disaster so it could make some sort of sense now that it's passed.
For me at least.

Medicine,https://old.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1jluhlj/had_my_first_baby_after_the_mother_attempted_an/,2180,187,Had my first baby after the mother attempted an abortion at home due to my state’s abortion ban,"I have been a NICU Respiratory Therapist for almost 10 years. In the largest NICU in my state. I have seen a lot of sad cases and infant death but I’m struggling quite a bit with this one. More than I have in a long time. My state like many others recently made abortion illegal with few exceptions. So I knew this day was going to come but nothing prepared me for just how bad this was. The baby had a severe case of a horrible extremely painful and gruesome fetal anomaly which I won’t say what it was. The anomaly isn’t always fatal so it doesn’t fall under one of the exceptions in the state for fatal anomalies. But with how horrible of an anomaly this was the mother tried to do the abortion at home. I don’t know much about the mother’s situation and I wouldn’t share anything if I did. But my state is at the very bottom in the country for access to prenatal care. So I would guess that she wasn’t made aware of the disease until late in the pregnancy. So when she attempted the abortion and had excessive blood loss and came to the maternity ED, the baby was far enough along we are required to resuscitate.
Even though the baby was not wanted, I still had to resuscitate. I had to get an airway and secure it and again in my 10 years experience, this was the most grisly thing I have ever done. And for what, the baby didn’t even live to 24 hours old. It was horrifying.
It’s been weeks now and I can’t get it out of my head. Due to the abortion ban, I knew something like this would happen but never like this. My heart is broken for that mom. My heart is broken for that baby and how much pain it must have been in. But the biggest feeling I have is anger for all those people that voted for it. I have been talking about and showing google pictures of the disease to everyone I know so they too can know the gravity of what this abortion ban means. Even though there are exceptions in the law, it doesn’t matter because either our access is so low that women are not able to get abortions even when they are suppose to be allowed to or they have a technically not 100% fatal disease and so are not except. This is so inhumane, I don’t know how I’m going to carry on doing what I do. Is this going to be my new normal? I have always had to deal with patients that I thought to myself they should have been aborted. But the parents made the decision to try anyway. But for this baby NO ONE I mean NO ONE in that deliver room wanted this baby. Everyone in the room from the mom, the dad, to the neonatologist did not want to have this baby born and have to resuscitate but some law maker and the people that voted for it that are not even in the fucking room or in the same universe of understanding are forcing us to. Im sitting here sick to my stomach about what happened and for the future of what this means and I don’t know if I can carry on with this.",

Medicine,https://old.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/s4q626/stupidity_on_the_newborn_unit/,2174,483,Stupidity on the newborn unit.,"I just came out of a newborn exam with a new understanding of the level of obtuseness and stupidity that surrounds us.  Here are a few of the highlights.  Mom presents to maternity in labor (after getting marginal pre-natal care elsewhere, so we don't have records), and presents an extensive 'legal birth plan' outlining her desire for a natural 'lotus' birth.  The birth plan is mainly printouts of various conspiracy quasi-medical websites offering distinctly non-rational arguments against almost everything we do in newborn care.  She and partner are Covid vaccine refusers, and they refuse Covid testing on admission, so we are stuck with full PPE and have to put her in one of our scarce isolation rooms.   After delivery, she refuses to allow us to weigh the baby (eventually she changed her mind).  She refuses HepB vaccination.  She refuses erythromcyin ointment ophthalmic prophylaxis.  She refuses Vitamin K administration.  She didn't get eval for gestation diabetes while pregnant so we don't know if baby is at risk for hypoglycemia, but she refuses chemstrips.  I don my full PPE to examine the baby and have a discussion hoping I can educate them regarding risks and benefits to all these refusals.  I go through my spiel, trying to be calm and measured and factual, and they keep pushing the long 'legal birth plan' document at me, and I keep trying to refute the lies and inaccuracies and distortions that they believe, and make zero progress.  And all the while, since this was an intended 'lotus delivery' (and they intend to keep the decaying placenta attached to the baby until the cord separates), the baby is lying in its bassinet next to a dead placenta.  Fortunately the baby had a normal exam, but something tells me that keeping a dead organ attached after birth is a perfect setup for sepsis, omphalitis, and a prolonged stay in the NICU.  These people seem outwardly to reasonable and rational; they listen to what I present, ask some questions which I answer to the best of my ability, and then say they will consider what I've said, and then go ahead and sign the hospital required waiver acknowledging that they have been advised of the risks of forgoing standard practice care and basically continue to refuse virtually all aspects of care.  I've had to deal with anti-vaxxers in Peds for a long time, but this level of ""I've done my own research"" and I don't value your years of training and experience and refuse to take your advice -- is a new level of just wanton stupidity.  It's my job to try to help people understand complex medical issues and make informed decisions, and usually I'm good at that, but this just confuses the hell out of me, particularly when they are making these decisions not for themselves, but for their children, and placing those children at a level of unnecessary risk.  I'm ready to pop, I'm so depressed.",

Now Sarah has checked in....","She's in her 50's and fairly healthy. Four of her extended family members died of COVID complications. Her husband died a few months ago. Tuesday Sarah started feeling bad, and went to the urgent care. Her rapid COVID was negative, she was given the usual thoughtless Rocephin/Dex combo and discharged.
Now Sarah is in the ER. She doesn't look terrible, but she knows what's coming. We talk about her husband, her family, and how things have been going. She's had a hard time as of late, having lost most of her family support system. Her rapid test comes back positive. Her labs and CXR aren't terrible. She wants to be admitted, but we know its not going to happen.
I didn't have it in me to ask her why she never got vaccinated. And at this point its too late, so why bother. So I send her out, with best wishes and close follow up. And while I keep feeling anger and resentment living in a state with one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country, right now I just feel pity for her.
And now that moment is over, and I am going to suit up to go talk to the next one, a 32 year old obese smoker with ""a cold"". She had to be asked twice by triage to put her mask on, and I can see through the window that she has already taken it off again and made herself at home in the exam room.",

a cease and desist order
from Comcast’s lawyers, claiming that
Comcastroturf.com
- a pro-net neutrality site encouraging Internet users to investigate an astroturfing campaign possibly funded by the cable lobby - violates Comcast’s ""valuable intellectual property."" The letter threatens legal action if the domain is not transferred to Comcast’s control.
The notice is ironic, in that it’s a perfect example of why we need Title II based net neutrality protections that ban ISPs from blocking or throttling content.
If the FCC’s current proposal is enacted, there would be nothing preventing Comcast from simply censoring this site -- or other sites critical of their corporate policies -- without even bothering with lawyers.
The legal notice can be viewed
here
. It claims that
Comcastroturf.com
violates the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act and infringes on Comcast’s trademarks. Of course, these claims are legally baseless, since the site is clearly a form of First Amendment protected political speech and makes no attempt to impersonate Comcast. (See the case ""
Bosley Medical Institute vs. Kremer
"" which held that a site critical of a company’s practices could not be considered trademark infringement, or the case Taubman vs. Webfeats, which decided that *sucks.com domain names—in this case taubmansucks.com—were free speech)
Comcastroturf.com
criticizes the cable lobby and encourages Internet users to search the Federal Communication Commission (FCC)’s docket to check if a fake comment was submitted using their name and address to attack Title II based net neutrality protections. It has been
widely reported
that more than 450,000 of these comments have been submitted to the FCC -- and as a result of the site at
Comcastroturf.com
, Fight for the Future
has heard
from dozens of people who say that anti-net neutrality comments were submitted using their personal information without their permission. We have connected individuals with Attorneys Generals and have called for the FCC act immediately to investigate this potential fraud.
Companies like Comcast have a long history of funding shady astroturfing operations like the one we are trying to expose with
Comcastroturf.com
, and also a long history of engaging in censorship. This is exactly why we need net neutrality rules, and why we can’t trust companies like Comcast to just ""behave"" when they have abused their power time and time again.
Fight for the Future has no intention of taking down
Comcastroturf.com
, and we would be happy to discuss the matter with Comcast in court.",

Internet-Wide Day of Action to Save Net Neutrality
that lots of us are planning for July 12th.
There's a huge amount of momentum. This morning PornHub (with 75 million daily visitors)
announced
that they will be participating. Since we announced earlier this month a ton of other high-traffic sites have signed on including Imgur, Amazon, Namecheap, OK Cupid, Bittorrent, Mozilla, Kickstarter, Etsy, GitHub, Vimeo, Chess.com, Fark, Checkout.com, Y Combinator, and Private Internet Access.
Reddit itself has also joined,
along with
more than 30 subreddits!
Net neutrality is the basic principle that prevents Internet Service Providers like Comcast and Verizon from charging us extra fees to access the content we want -- or throttling, blocking, and censoring websites and apps. Title II is the legal framework for net neutrality, and the FCC is trying to get rid of it, under immense pressure for the Cable lobby.
This day of action is an incredibly important moment for the Internet to come together -- across political lines -- and show that we don't want our Cable companies controlling what we can do online, or picking winners and losers when it comes to streaming services, games, and online content.
The current FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, is a former Verizon lawyer and seems intent on getting rid of net neutrality and misleading the public about it. But the FCC has to answer to Congress. If we can create another moment of massive online protest like the SOPA Blackout and the Internet Slowdown, we have a real chance of stopping the FCC in its tracks, and protecting the Internet as a free and open platform for creativity, innovation, and exchange of ideas.
So! If you've got a website, blog, Tumblr, or any kind of social media following, or if you are a subreddit mod or active in an online community or forum, please get involved! There's so much we as redditors can do, from blacking out our sites to drive emails and phone calls to organizing in-person meetings with our lawmakers. Feel free to message me directly or email team (at) fightforthefuture (dot) org to get involved, and
learn more here.
EDIT:
Oh hai, everyone! Very glad you're here. Lots of awesome brainstorming happening in the comments. Keep it coming. A lot of people are asking what sites will be doing on July 12. We're still encouraging brainstorming and creativity, but the basic idea is that sites will have a few options of things they can do to their homepage to show what the web would be like without net neutrality, ie a slow loading icon to show they are stuck in the slow lane, a ""site blocked"" message to show they could be censored, or an ""upgrade your Internet service to access this site"" fake paywall to show how we could be charged special fees to access content. Love all your ideas! Keep sharing, and
go here for more info about the protest.
EDIT 2:
It's worth noting that given the current chairman of the FCC's political orientation, it's extra important that conservatives, libertarians, and others to the right of center speak out on this issue. The cable lobby is working super hard to turn this technological issue into a partisan circus. We can't let them. Net neutrality protects free speech, free markets, innovation, and economic opportunity. We need people and sites from all across the political spectrum to be part of this.",

india,https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f9outu/fuck_all_religion/,19492,4101,Fuck all Religion,"Fuck all religion. Fuck Hindusim, fuck Islam, fuck Christianity, fuck Buddhism. Fuck you all for believing in this made up bullshit called Religion. You know what I think about your religions? I think it is a waste of time, I think it is just another fairytale for childish adults who cant grasp the concept of death. They all want to just believe in something good after death. Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing. Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova.
You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But what matter itself, is being part of this universe.
But, you are here in the now. You are existing in this world where time passes and the universe is larger than anything you can fathom. So why do you keep insisting on believing in man made stories. There is No God, there is no rebirth, there is no heaven or hell. But there is this universe, where we all exist. Religion has brought us nothing but hardship and mass murder on a scale that would make the Spanish flu look like a minor common cold. Just take a step back and look at the past and see the countless lives that were lost because religion asked to do so. None of your religions are without blood in your hands. All of your religions have committed brutal acts of mass murder. And none of your religions have been able to answere any of the basic questions to life death or reincarnation.
False prophet and make believe deities, is what religion is.
Let go of these childish beliefs people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your destiny. Believe in the humanity of people, have faith on people. We are all part of this speck of dust, flying through the universe.  What determines our immortality is not what you did for your religion, but what you did for the future of this little speck of dust flying through the universe. Your legacy should and always be the betterment of mankind.
A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa. We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries,  we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 °C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. But this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the Stone age.
Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.

The whole argument from their side is BS.
They finally accepted that Wolf Gupta is imaginary. Why didn't they accept this earlier?
Check the document, and see for yourself all their hollow claims. The link at the end.
I am looking for lawyers. Got a lot of numbers. Talking to them right now.
One good lawyer suggested I back out, sign an apology and end it, said will cost you 30k rupees only, and that's it.
I won't back out. (Although my parents still don't know what mess I have indulged myself into. But I feel I will be able to handle them.)
Why did WhiteHatJr take this risky step? Like it seems like it won't go in their favor in public. Yet they took this desperate step. Because they know what I know and they want me to stop sharing it out there in public. Their lawsuit is to get interim junction and make me stop showing it to everyone. And even try to take down all my videos/posts/Reddit everything.
In the past 9 days, I tried if some big publication would write about it. But no one did. (Apart from one, Thanks to
Morning Context
and Ashish K Mishra for the article).
So what is it that they are trying to bury so hard?
This spreadsheet, the LIST of all the videos/tweets/links/posts/LinkedIn/Facebook/IG/ quora/Reddit/(9gag also) they reported and took down. The list contains over 700 such links. (If I included the comments of the parents that they were removing, the list would be over 2k)
Here is the List: Download, find these people, and tell them what happened to their posts. If your content was also taken down find it here: 
<As per court orders I have removed the link>
There is more. The whole company reeks of lies and deceit. Once I said I will find out who Wolf Gupta and who all these fictitious kids are. Now that the media is silent, here is the birth story of such kids and their 'apps'. And you tell me if I was wrong when I called this company a FRAUD.
<removed after Delhi HC orders on 24/11/2020 >
Neither the kids existed, nor the apps. And they really created a $300 million company around it.
If that is now fraud what it? Now I think now you can understand why the threats, why this case, why they are talking so much risk but not looking at their own mistakes. This proof was shared with one journalist but they ignored it. Now you can understand why the media was silent.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now, what do I do here?
I have three options.
Back out. Apologize and move on. Which I won't.
Hire a normal lawyer on my own and they would drag this case and make me exhausted.
As seen in many tweets today, many of you asked me to start a fund and where all can chip in and hire the best lawyer possible.
Please write in the comments which option should be taken. If option #3, please quote how much can you contribute for real, also suggest to me how to start a fundraiser and what platforms are good for it. WhiteHatJr has already spent 25 lakhs on preparing this case. So legal fights are costly. I alone can only go to a point until my pockets are empty.
Thanks
Pradeep Poonia

Some requests:
PLEASE don't suggest me to contact Xyz, it takes time. Each email needs to be written accordingly. I would REALLY appreciate if you write emails to different journalist/YouTubers on my behalf. I am already running out of time. A lot has to be in the next few hours.
Some one please cross-post this in different subreddutts.
WRITE about this issue. Let's not wait for the media. I have posted most of the proofs on youtube and my Twitter. Please write blogs etc about this. Can someone also try to post this issue on LinkedIn, I am banned from there.
Share etc do all that. You see how to spread this news now. Make a small poster kind of thing, those seem to work better than such long texts.
I might not be able to reply to comments and DMs today, please don't mind.
Thanks again
Pradeep Poonia.

india,https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nboonh/what_is_actually_happening_in_nepal/,11477,650,What is Actually Happening in Nepal ?? Misinformation by Indian Media.,"Hello to my fellow neighbors in India.
I am a
Nepali citizen
living near the border, connected to both our countries not only geographically but also culturally. That is why I feel it is my duty to share the truth with you about what is really happening here.
You may have seen headlines claiming that Nepal is facing
“mass protests led by Gen Z against social media ban.”
That is only a half-truth.
Here is the real sequence of events:
Three days ago, the Nepal government suddenly banned 26 social media platforms including Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, YouTube, and Reddit.
They claimed it was about registration and taxes. But these companies are already registered and paying taxes. The real motive is censorship: giving the government power to control online information, delete posts critical of them within 24 hours, and jail those who speak up.
In the next two days, criticism exploded across the country. A date was set—September 8—for nationwide protests. But it was never just about social media. That ban was only the spark.
Our patience had already run out.
Soon, the “
Nepo Babies
” trend erupted in Nepal. It exposed the lavish lifestyles of politicians’ children—designer (clothes,bags, watches, attire )worth lakhs, luxury cars, million-rupee homes, weekly international flights, and even private jets—while ordinary Nepalis struggle daily for survival. Our PM has a salary less than 65k INR but what is owns is in million of $$$.
This hit a nerve.
 Because Nepal has been under one form of tyranny or another for decades. From monarchy to so-called democracy, corruption and instability have never left us. Not a single prime minister has completed a full term in over 20 years.
[The protests were organized in the name of Gen Z, but they welcomed everyone. We were not just protesting a social media ban. We were standing against corruption, nepotism, tyranny, suppression, and decades of betrayal. In a country of just 30 million people, every single day around 5,000 youths leave to work abroad because there are no jobs, no decent pay, and no basic livelihood at home.]
And then the tragedy struck. Today, during the protest, I witnessed & carried something I will never forget. A 15-year-old schoolboy, still in uniform, was shot in the head by security forces—acting on orders from a minister. He was not the only one. Reports say more than 20 people have been killed, thousands injured, and the true numbers are being hidden.
I came home with blood still on my hands, only to see Indian news channels spinning a completely false narrative. They claimed it was all about social media and mocked our youths as being “
addicted
” to it. That angered me, but it didn’t surprise me. I know how the media can twist things.
That is why I am writing this here, to let you know the truth from the ground.

I suspected these to be gunshots as, well you know. I messaged my group chat about it and they said they heard the same things. Some guy said **** Market (a very populous place where I go, like, on a daily basis) was destroyed. Even rn I dont know if he was lying or not, but who knows. I ran upstairs and told my family about all this and we went up to the roof to see what was happening. Oh man, I have never felt anything like I felt then. Whole ass missiles were flying. We quickly turned off all the lights and went to my room, where we are still sitting. Light had gone for a long time and we were constantly looking at news on my pc. And turns out I was lucky. Although I live in one of the most major parts of Jammu, there was not much damage here. According to the Descriptions of my other friends' situations in the group chat, they supposedly had it a lot worse. Right around 9 PM, light came back and most of the people in my neighborhood have turned on their lights (I find that to be dumb). These have the longest hours of my life, and im just telling u half of the story. Much more happened in my house but its kinda personal so I cant say here. Anyways im still very worried because this is definitely not the end of the war or worse, there can be more attacks even tonight. They struck army airport, hospital, which was thankfully intercepted by the Indian Airforce. so they clearly have a very bad plan in their mind (Pakistan). Anyways I wish yall peace.
EDIT: So it is 2:15 right now and I heard sirens. Shit. But theyre gone now they were only playing for a few minutes
EDIT 2: It has been 18 days since I made this post. Thankfully me and my family are safe. This was a pretty crazy experience though. I cannot be grateful enough for the love and support yall gave me.",
india,https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/qo1ol8/i_am_sophie_zhang_fb_whistleblower_when_i_found/,9468,536,"I am Sophie Zhang, FB whistleblower. When I found fake accounts manipulating Indian politics, FB approved their removal - until they discovered that some of them were being ran by a sitting MP. The Lok Sabha is considering asking me to testify, but Reddit gets to go first. Ask me anything.","Hi,
r/india
I'm Sophie Zhang. At Facebook, I worked in my spare time at Facebook to stop major political figures/parties and world governments from using the platform to deceive their own citizenry - a deeply exhausting task that I've compared to trying to empty the ocean with a colander. When I was fired in September 2020, I stayed up until 8am in the morning to write a 7,800 word internal memo that was
leaked to the press against my objections.
I testified privately
to the INGE committee of the European Parliament in October 2020 even though I was refusing all public appearances, because they asked and my duty to democracy came first. I
went public with the Guardian
in April of this year because the problems of social media will never be solved unless directly confronted. Three weeks ago, I
testified before the British Parliament.
​
I worked across dozens of countries to protect civic discourse - ranging from Argentina to Albania, from India to Iraq, and more. The most pressing of my discoveries occurred when I personally caught the national governments of
Honduras
and
Azerbaijan
using fake assets to exploit and mislead their own citizenry on massive scales. I was also deeply concerned with Albania, where
an apparent state-sponsored network associated with the ruling Socialist Party
was similarly misleading Albanian citizens, but was unable to resolve the investigation before my departure.
In India during late 2019 and early 2020, I found an eventual total of five separate networks of fake accounts across the political spectrum supporting the INC (2), AAP (1), and BJP (2.) The pro-AAP network was acting to manipulate discourse in the Delhi 2020 elections, a fact that was very concerning to myself. Although Delhi is a local state of India, it has a population comparable to small countries such as Taiwan (fortunately I live in the U.S. and aren't in danger from saying this.) I was able to have four out of the five networks taken down (2 pro-INC network, 1 pro-AAP, and 1 pro-BJP.) FB employees approved the takedown of the fifth network, one supporting the BJP, but everything suddenly went silent
after we discovered they were connected to the account of the benefiting MP (meaning that someone with access to the MP's personal account was almost certainly running the fake accounts.)
​
My disclosures of these events have led to
considerable
recent
interest in India
, including
a call by the Internet Freedom Foundation
for myself and Frances Haugen to testify before the Lok Sabha. I arranged this AMA when I was being impatient and took the silence from the Lok Sabha to indicate that they were uninterested in calling me to testify. Since then, MP Shashi Tharoor, the Chairman of the Standing Committee on IT, has
publicly announced
that the committee is seeking approval from the Speaker to allow my testimony.
​
Separate from this,
I have also written an article on autolikers
, which are common in the Global South (including India.) Many Indians sign up for what appear to be free likes, not realizing that by doing so they have given over their credentials to shady middlemen where they may eventually be sold to e.g. an IT cell.
​
Because it often results in confusion, I want to be clear that I worked on fake accounts and inauthentic behavior - an issue that is separate from misinformation/fake news/etc. Misinformation depends solely on your words; if you write ""Cats and dogs are the same species"", it doesn't matter who you are: it's still misinformation. In contrast, inauthenticity depends solely on the user; if I dispatch 1000 fake accounts onto Reddit to comment ""Cats are adorable"", the words don't matter - it's still inauthentic behavior. If Reddit takes the fake accounts down, they're correct to do so no matter how much I yell ""they're censoring cute cats!""
​
There are genuine questions regarding how to respond to misinformation and hate speech while protecting freedom of speech. But no one serious defends the right of a politician to set up a network of inauthentic accounts supporting himself. Stopping this is necessary to protect freedom of speech, not a violation of those principles - just as stopping ballot stuffing is necessary to protect the sanctity of the ballot and the right to vote.
​
If you're interested in other things I've done, I've also written
a guide to whistleblowing
, and an op-ed arguing that the
United States is too worried about Russian social media interference
. If you have personal questions about my life,
there's a profile of me in MIT Technology Review.
​
Please ask me anything.  I might not be able to answer every question, but if so, I'll do my best to explain why I can't.

On 15th January when the pickup person came, he for the 1st time opened the box in-front of me and when he did the box was containing a defected and old PS3 instead of a Playstation 5 which I ordered. Due to which they didn’t pick up the order. I have to chat with them numerous time after which they scheduled a pickup and after the pickup was done yesterday I got to know that they have put a hold on the refund because according to them they shipped the right item & are not refunding my money. Even though I have provided them with pictures from the date of delivery & pickup along with the delivery guy opening the box for the 1st time.
I am adding all the pictures I have from the date of delivery to the date the delivery guy came to pick it up & opened it for me.
Now they are saying they cannot promise me my refund.
PS : My only fault is that I panicked seeing the box and didn’t open it right then and waited for the delivery guy (the fraud) to come and open it for me.

science,https://old.reddit.com/r/science/comments/7e1jo1/raising_the_taxes_of_graduate_students_by_as_much/,124380,10822,Raising the taxes of graduate students by as much as 300% will be a disaster for the USA,"Science and technology development has been the story of the past 100 years.  The discoveries and innovations are progressing at a dazzling rate, much of this lead by researchers at universities in the USA.  At these universities, a substantial amount of the work is done by graduate students, who work long hours (80 hours weeks aren't unusual) for little pay.  These graduate students go on to work in good paying jobs, where their innovations make more jobs for others.
Start-ups develop to bring new innovations based on the skills graduate students learn (Google was the project of a couple of Stanford grad students, even Reddit benefited from the skills of a physics grad student/PhD,
/u/keysersosa
, the current CTO.)  Grad school has been for decades a path to prosperity for  those who come from humble beginnings but are willing to work hard, and make sacrifices, a system that has greatly benefited all of us.
This is why we scientists are shocked and appalled by the recently passed tax bill in congress which will result in the tax bills of already poor grad students
going up by as much as 300%
, which would see their take-home pay drop by 25%. As a former grad student myself, I can tell you that I would not have been able to continue if my pay had be reduced by $7,000, and many students would make the same conclusion.  Instead, some will not go into science or they will leave the USA to be a grad student in Europe or Asia, most of these students will never return to the USA.
This is why every major science organization has
voiced opposition to the current tax plan
, make no mistake, this plan will
undermine research and eventually the economy of the USA
.
In comic form from
PhD Comics
.
What can we do to stop it?  Call your representatives in congress and let them know.  It hasn't passed yet, but it's about to.  If we don't raise voices now, we will all regret it.

Took him to my local vet after work this afternoon. He wasnt muscle spasming as much and he could feels legs be it was like he didn't know how to use them. Got a microchip number off him, he was a past patient!
Owner said, we don't want him anymore he is mean...
So they obviously threw out their declawed family cat to die innthis horrible heat wave... Not expecting him to be found...
So i renamed him in their system and took him over. Vet was worried about rabies with his nuero issues and I cuddled with him as he drifted to sleep. I've known him less than 24 hrs and i loved him.

Her biggest pride and joy were her cats, Olive and Pearl (the black cat and the grey tabby, respectively). I was never a cat person so I never truly wanted any, much to her dismay, and our living situations throughout the years meant we couldn’t have any. However, a couple years ago we were finally able to move into an apartment with just the two of us and quickly she made plans to get a cat. Not even a month into living there did she finally get her wish by bringing in the little runt of a litter from one of her friends. She didn’t even consult with me beforehand but nothing I could have said would have stopped her from bringing in Olive. I remember the moment she first took Olive out of her carrier for the first time and she just broke down crying. At that moment I felt an immense shame of having not tried hard enough not figure out a way to get her a cat sooner. But no matter, she was finally happy and a year later she also brought in little Pearl, who she selflessly decided to let me name.
Everyday her cats would rest and sleep on her. Now they rest on her side of the bed. When I’ve been coming home from the ICU, they greet me but I can see their eyes linger a little at the door, as if they expect their mom to follow shortly after.
It’s hard to say how conscious my gf was at the very end, if anything I said to her would reach her, but I promised her I would keep her cats protected forever and that I would love them the way she loved them. She made me a cat person and I’ll always love her for that.","['https://preview.redd.it/fts5n9134nbe1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=a5e30b7cb7b62848c8cfdd9279afbc6dd10aa22b', 'https://preview.redd.it/xozufw034nbe1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=bfd312f70a506a613770305f01eee1d8d3feaa5e', 'https://preview.redd.it/dsz9cw034nbe1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=02b601b921321965a215c84cf453429a763f3a63', 'https://preview.redd.it/pq17bw034nbe1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=1a051a8ed1bb6a21884acce9b841078c04373501', 'https://preview.redd.it/0614fy034nbe1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=8a74a9b2952613a25234d3e7f223cb2f06aa6219']"

-Owner 2 surrendered him to a shelter where they discover that his teeth are so decayed that most of them need pulled. After having most of his teeth removed, he still wouldn't eat. He had been in so much pain for so long that he gave up on living. He was put on IVs so that he could get the nutrients he needed. After 3 days, he felt well enough to finally eat again.
-After recovering, he was placed in his first foster home. They ended up loving him so much that they had planned on adopting him. Unfortunately, the foster ended up having a medical emergency and will need a long hospital stay, so she could no longer care for PJ

So I got his $40K pool filled in.,"I live with my mom. She’s quiet, keeps to herself, never bothers anyone. A few months ago, our new neighbor decided to report her to the city for having an “illegal shed” in the backyard.
It was total BS, the shed’s been there for years and has full permits. An inspector came out, checked everything, and left without saying a word.
But the neighbor? Smug. Proud. Thought he’d scared us.
So I did a little digging.
Turns out his brand-new pool was way too close to the property line and illegally built over a utility easement.
I reported him. Attached photos. Quoted city codes.
Two weeks later, the city ordered him to either move it (impossible) or fill it in. He lost the whole thing $40,000 down the drain. Literally.
Now he gets to look at our completely legal shed every day… while standing over a pile of dirt where his pool used to be.

Probably got weeks, maybe couple months at best. I am 22, don’t own a house, don’t own my car. Have maybe £2k in the bank. 
So I took out a credit card, 6.5k limit, 0% APR for 20 months. (I was previously building up a good credit score) and am now buying whatever the fuck I want. The debt will die with me, and I give no fucks.
And if you want to beef me about driving your bank fees up with this behaviour, at least you get to live. lol
EDIT:: Thank you all for your amazing responses. Unfortunately it’s bone cancer that has spread through my whole body, so I’m too weak now to travel far, as much as I would have wanted to see the world.
I’m going to go bigger, and do some good stuff, if you have ideas. I want to do some big donations to food banks and cancer charities that supported me through my journey and make some differences before I pop.
Alsos shame on you all of you asking me for money.
UPDATE 2:
Took out some more cards, thanks for the suggestions
Some of you asking, I’m a girl haha
I’ve bought lots of things for my family, mostly sentimental things with my handwriting on.
I bought a crab at a fancy ass seafood place. That was awesome
I’ve donated to animal shelters and food banks. Also to the cancer charities who helped drag my ass through this.
Also can y’all stop telling me to find Jesus, I respect those of you who are praying for me, because I know that’s your way of thinking of me and I’m really touched by that.
But finding god is in no way in my plans and not what I believe will happen after death, trying to force religion down a dying persons throat is really not the vibe.
Update 3:
Still hanging on, I’ve deteriorated quite a lot now, lost a lot of functionality in my body at this point so I’m bedbound and mostly just watching lots of TV and seeing family. But I’m comfortable, eating apples and cheese and lots of little treats. Thank you all for still checking in and thinking of me.
I’m really fortunate to be surrounded by my friends and family right now, when you boil it all down to it in the end, it really is all you need.

And it’s not because I didn’t want to attend that concert, I really wanted that, but not even one of my friend agreed, it’s not about the concert only, I am a person who lives alone and my family lives in a different town, I see people on their birthday getting tagged in shit ton of stories or post, but no one ever tags me, i didn’t even got a call from my family I had a friend who used to call it at exactly 12 but today I didn’t even get that call, I asked my office colleagues to celebrate my birthday with me and I will sponsor liquor’s and cakes and everything yet they said they had plan for weekends, i hope I am not a terrible person, I think I am but I always wished people on time, I never purposefully hurt anyone but if I did I am sorry, I never did that though, I think they did not like how I look maybe, I have vitiligo and I am not that successful for my age, because I am little under confident, is that why people hate me, I don’t know why people hate me cause if I am unsuccessful I can be successful but that’s not it, maybe they hate that I have vitiligo, maybe that’s the reason, but I didn’t ask for it, I just got it, but can people just hate me just because I have vitiligo, I think so, I wouldn’t hate anyone though, I love all kind of people even the one who literally beaten the shit out of me when I was school because I got offended cause they were making jokes on my skin condition, maybe I shouldn’t got offended at that time, and they were only having fun I could have ignored them or maybe laughed with them, that might have resulted in a good friendship maybe, they might have wished me, I think I was always the problem, that’s why not even my parents loves me as they love my brother, he’s successful, he’s abroad with his wife and a dog, they are amazing, they didn’t wish me though it’s okay it’s still not over his office hours he is 6 hrs behind so he might have forgotten and it’s Okay, he’s busy, but he was the only one who understood me, but then when he got married and he got busy and it’s understandable, hope he becomes more successful, even last year he forgot my birthday, because he had this big project he was working, my friend that always called me he didn’t call though, he said he was travelling, might be that, I think people forget me cause I am not that important, and that’s fine I don’t add anything but only takes, I think I am Terrible for not adding value in life of people maybe after that only people will call me on my birthday, but I think it’s too late now cause I think if I leave now, no one would be that hurt as they already created distance from me, and they won’t feel sad, i am a terrible person and maybe that’s why my ex called got married to someone else, she took a right decision who wants a person who will always be vulnerable infront of them, although I was strong when she told me that she’s getting married in 3 weeks, and her roka is day after tomorrow, I didn’t shed a single tear and didn’t uttered an emotional word, I just left saying congratulations enjoy your life, she might thought I am heartless, well I was heartbroken not heartless but I can understand her POV, I think you can understand why I am a terrible person, and isn’t it better to sleep forever not knowing what happened to you
Edit: I don’t know what to write now?
Just that there are literally close to 2k people that actually wanted to be my friend and wished me, I was crying last night that not even single person called or messaged and I woke up with so many wishes, my phone is heating because of all the notifications I have been getting

So I bought a 12-pack of LaCroix because, you know, that’s what the cool, healthy people were drinking. First sip? It tasted like someone whispered the word “fruit” into a cup of TV static. Absolutely disgusting. But I had already posted it on my Instagram story with the caption: “New addiction lol.”
And that was the beginning of my downfall.
Friends started bringing LaCroix over when they visited. Coworkers stocked it in the office fridge “because I liked it.” My girlfriend (now fiancée) thought it was cute how “into sparkling water” I was, so she bought me a SodaStream for Christmas.
Now I’m in too deep. I’ve become the guy who nods thoughtfully while drinking what is essentially spicy sadness. I have flavors in my fridge with names like “Pamplemousse” and “Limoncello,” and I pretend like I can tell the difference. I can’t. It all tastes like carbonated regret.
Sometimes I just want a normal drink. But if I ever open a Gatorade, someone will say, “Whoa, no LaCroix today?” and I’ll just fake laugh like, “Haha, gotta switch it up!” Meanwhile my soul is quietly screaming.
Anyway, if you’re young and reading this: never lie about your beverages. That stuff will haunt you.

confession,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/c11din/im_putting_my_extremely_profoundly_disabled_7/,66691,2789,I'm putting my extremely profoundly disabled 7 year old into a residential facility so I can forget he exists. I'm not sorry.,"I can't tell anyone this, even my therapist. Lambast me if you wanr and maybe I even deserve it. I only ask what you would do if you were in my situation. Not what you think ""people should"" do. What you would REALLY do.
I'm a single mom of 2 boys. 12 and 7. My husband passed away 3 years ago in a work accident. A very large portion of me believe it was a suicide. I can't see him EVER making the mistake he made that caused his death, and he had taken an action just before that which ensured his co-workers weren't in the room. I fully believe he killed himself because of our younger son and no one will ever change my mind.
We were told when I was pregnant that he would have Downs Syndrome. We could handle that. Even if it was severe. It turned out he has a chromosome deletion. His disorder is kind of rare so I won't post which specific one but suffice to say he'll never be anything more than he is now or has ever been.
And what he is, is nothing.
He doesn't appear to have any awareness and never has. His eyes are locked in one position, he doesn't respond to noise, touch, or pain. He is total care. He is capable of nothing. He is tube fed and on oxygen. He is in diapers and will be forever. He makes no sounds, no attempts to communicate. He never even really cried as a baby.
He has never made an attempt to interact with anyone or his environment.
I'm not upset because I got a special needs/""imperfect"" child. I feel the way I feel because this...... thing..... takes up 200% of my time and does NOTHING. I didn't get an imperfect child. I didn't get
a child
.
I don't love him. He doesn't have any personality, there is nothing to love. And yet I'm responsible for him. In addition to his extreme delays he's also medically fragile. Respiratory crises, fecal impactions (his autonomic nervous system doesn't function properly), issues with his G tube, infections, pressure sores no matter WHAT we put him on or how we position him.
Our older son has suffered because his non existent brother has colored everything in his life. He's had medical care get delayed because there's only one of me and hos brother is more critical. We do have a visiting home nurse but only 20 hrs/week and we aren't eligible for more. I was starting law school, I gave up my dreams and my plan for my children for this potato. My older son can't do a lot of things he wants to do because of the youngers need for care and appointments.
The final straw was I heard a sound. I went into Younger Son's room to check, thinking he had forgotten how to breathe again, and saw Older Son hitting him and screaming ""You're why I don't have a mother! You're why I don't have a father! You're why I can't have friends over! You're why I can't be in sports! I didn't ask for you and I hope you die!""
Instead of being horrified, I watched. And Younger Son just did. not. react. No signs of pain or fear or upset. No reaction at all.
He breathes but he is not alive. He doesn't know who I am. He doesn't know who Older Son is. He has no sense of self, life experience, or awareness of his surroundings.
He doesn't need to be in my home. He doesn't know or care where he is. He is genetically my son but he is not family. My previously abused, brain damaged cat who can't walk straight has more personality and is far more loveable than my ""child"". In fact I was looking FORWARD to raising a Downs baby. Even one with severe impairments, for that reason. With disability can come gifts. This boy is not a gift. He is a genetic mistake I probably should have miscarried and would have definitely terminated if I'd known he would be like this. And the flip side is, if he HAS awareness..... he's miserable. And there is nothing I can do. If he has likes and dislikes no one knows what they are. If he is in pain he can't tell anyone. If he wants anything, he can't communicate. He's had every imaginable therapy, nothing has made a difference.
And so he's leaving our home on the 29th. I feel excited and relieved and then guilty because I know we'll be happier with him gone.
He's already taken my husband and my son's father. He was working so so so much OT to pay for the cucumber's care. For the experimental therapies insurance wouldn't cover. Because THIS one was going to be the BREAKTHROUGH. He was tired and defeated and disappointed. He sought counseling as well but I don't think he could ever say the words ""I don't want my son in my home"" either.
He's ruined my older son. I was so wrapped up on the younger I never realized how ignored and damaged he was. He lost his father too. I didn't just lose my husband. HE is my priority now and this malignant lump can be someone else's problem. At least they'll be paid a wage to care for him. At least they'll get a break from him when they punch out.
I just want to never think of him again and I'm not sorry. And for that, I'm sorry.
Thanks for reading.
Edit: Thanks
/u/piconeeks
, for calling me a liar. Are you a medical doctor? If your Google Fu was any good you would have stumbled on 3p mosaic deletion-duplication syndrome. That is the disorder my son has. I've basically identified myself by posting that but hey, it's better than the PMs telling me to kill myself. If you look at the features of 3p deletion syndromes
they look like Downs
. My insurance didn't cover AFP testing which would have told us it WASN'T Downs and I didn't think we needed it. I had a regular ultrasound and a 3D. Both Drs were ""99% sure it was Downs"".
This post was absolutely NOT fiction. Instead the mods and especially
/u/piconeeks
just ""decided"" it was.
If anyone would like I'll doxx myself. You can see my ID to verify my name, my marriage license, and my husband's death certificate. I will then link you to the news article of the ""freak industrial accident"" that ended his life so you can see it's the same person.
As for not choosing hospice for my son - I can't. About a year ago I myself was hospitalized with severe depression and C-PTSD (there is proof of that too). During that time my late husbands mother petitioned to get control as my son's medical proxy and got it. I'm fighting it but it's a long, complicated process. There are competency hearings. There are statements from doctors and evaluations. Unless SHE oks hospice, which she refuses, I cannot decide that. I have custody. I cannot ake medical decisions. She agreed to residential care which I feel is the second best option. So, he's going into residential care.
As for ""mistaking"" a child choking with hitting, I was downstairs. I couldn't hear what my older son was saying. I only knew he was speaking. Go punch a blanket or, idk, a person with weak muscle tone. Then ask said person with weak muscle done to cough. They don't cough normally/forcefully. It's more a ""strong puff"". Similar to, again.... idk... a muted punch. When you're used to jumping at every strange sound, it's difficult to discern what's what sometimes.
So,

This was back when internet research was not admissible, and you needed to properly cite all your sources.
School & life got away from me, and I forgot about them for a while.  That was until the end of the semester when I got a late library dues bill in the mail.  I think the fees were 25 cents per book per day - if not more - and I had at least 10 books over a month  late!  I didn't have any money, and if you had outstanding library dues, you could not get your grades/transcript for the semester.
Instead of sheepishly returning the books and paying the fines, I put the books in my backpack, smuggled them into the library, and returned them all to their correct places on the shelves.  I then called the library the next day and questioned the validity of the letter regarding my overdue books.

Started dating when I was 17. Yes, it was gross but that's what happened. The only reason he married me is because I was hot. The only reason I married him is because he had money. I actually do have other redeeming characteristics but he married me because I was hot. I know this. Everyone knows this. It doesn't feel great but I can deal with it. We've been married 20 years. 4 kids. So we are stable and we have lots in common at this point. And we do love each other. But if I could go back and slap myself I would.
What nobody tells you- or they try and you don't listen because you're a dumbass teenager- is that marrying like this means you will fucking owe him. For everything. Every goddamn day. Not just in the bedroom but in every other matter in your life. The stuff you never imagined someone else trying to decide for you. And you don't just owe him for the money. It's a lot heavier than that. He'll never say it out loud. But you'll know the deal. Fundamentally unequal. He'll pull rank at the most random times and it will make you feel like you're falling through the floor.
I don't hate my life or anything. I accept that I made this bed and I have to lie in it but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else. My oldest daughter is two years younger than I was when I met my husband and I can't imagine.",

My father was a raging asshole. He used to beat us and yell at us about how worthless we were constantly. My mother finally had enough, and said that either he gets psychological help, or she leaves him. He went to the doctor, and was prescribed an antipsychotic medication. When he started taking it, he magically became nice! No more beatings, no more yelling... it was paradise. Then, after a while, he turned mean again. We asked our Mom what was going on, and she said that he stopped taking his medication because he didn't like the side effects, whatever that meant. We felt doomed. Until one day, my mom accidentally? left his prescription bottle in the kitchen. My sister and I looked at each other and didn't even have to say a thing. She got out a spoon and I ground the white pill into powder, and we put it in his orange juice. What a nice day we had! We did this every single day, enjoying our temporary happy home, until the prescription ran out. It was the best month of our childhood, and I'm not sorry.
Edit:
For those saying that antipsychotics take weeks to work, that’s not always the case (in contrast, antidepressants often take weeks to work). People have commented that they’ve taken antipsychotics such as Latuda, Promazine or Seroquel, and they claim they feel the effects in hours. FYI, I have no memory of exactly what drug he was on.

I had to make the right turn abut 7:20am every day. For a long time I would just break the law and make my turn any way or go around if I thought there was too many people watching. But (maybe out of boredom) I did a bit of research and found the ticket for the illegal turn was more than buying a sign from the supplier that makes signs for our area and several other locations. So I ordered a new sign that was 'no right turn between 7:30am- 9:30am'. I figured it was a good investment. I went to the trouble of buying it through an alias and having it sent to a location that was not at all near to where I was. Real cloak and dagger stuff, but it was part of the fun.
Then in the middle of the night I went and removed two bolts and put up the new sign.
At first I was expecting for it to be removed or someone look into to it, but it is more than a decade later and no one ever noticed or changed it.
BTY, Yes I did think of just taking it down, but I figured that would be noticed by someone, and to be honest the whole scheme of getting a new one was part of the fun.

Years ago, I went on a date with this girl who was obsessed with peanut butter. She kept pushing me to try her peanut butter smoothie, even after I said I wasn’t in the mood. Instead of just saying no, I blurted out, ""Oh, I can’t—I’m allergic.""
Big mistake.
She was super concerned, asked a million questions, and I figured, whatever, I’d never see her again. But then she introduced me to her friend group. And they all knew about my ""allergy."" At that point, correcting it felt too awkward.
Fast forward six years. I’m still friends with these people. My “allergy” is a known fact. They warn restaurants for me, they check ingredients, one of them even threw out a peanut butter cake someone brought to a party ""just to be safe.""
The worst part? I love peanut butter. I eat it in secret. I have a stash at work. Once, my best friend said, ""Man, it must suck not knowing what a Reese’s tastes like."" And I just nodded solemnly.
Now, my girlfriend (who also believes I’m allergic) wants us to move in together… and she’s super cautious about food. I’m terrified she’ll find my peanut butter stash and think I’ve been LYING TO HER.
Which I have. For years.
I have no idea how to get out of this. Do I fake a ""miracle recovery""? A medical misdiagnosis? Or do I just keep the lie going forever?

Lights behind me so I pull over. I know I’ve barely got any gas at all and was almost to a gas station, hence why I rolled through the stop a little. Trying not to have the car die.
At the time (around 1995) a new digital phone had come out called Voicesteam (now TMoblie) and their whole big thing was the phones were digital and not cellular. They were the first phones with caller ID and one of the big things the salesman had said over and over was since it was digital the signal couldn’t be triangulated or traced. Not that I cared but it stuck in my mind.
Well as I give the cop my license, registration and insurance card I got an idea. I knew if I was late to work I was going to lose my job. They were super strict there.
So I get an idea and right after I hand the papers to the cop and he’s walking back to his cruiser I called 911 and tell the operator I just saw a guy with what looked like a shot gun walk into a 7-11 that was about 2 blocks away. I confirmed the address then I hung up.
About 30 seconds later the cops comes sprinting to my car and hands me all my stuff and rushed says, “come to a complete stop next time!!” Then peels off to the direction of the store.
Pushed my car to the gas station that I’d almost made it to and felt pretty pleased with my ingenuity.
I was an idiot and I confess!
Edit: Wow, this blew up.  I forgot to mention I would have gotten arrested, booked and released, because I was driving with a suspended license for unpaid traffic tickets and I had a bench warrant for it.  Because I’m an idiot!

A lot of people were asking for an update so here it is.
I wrote up a long ass apology letter that I wanted to read to my brother. I waited until he got home and got into bed for the night.
I knocked on his door and he was so fucking excited that it was me. I couldn't even get through the first few words. I started crying after saying ""I wanted to say I'm really sorry"" and just couldn't get through it.
I just got into bed with him and laid down next to him. He hugged me really tight and said ""I missed you buddy"".
I fucking lost it. I never cried that bad before. He just hugged me for a long time until I calmed down. We didn't talk much. He started crying for a bit too. It was the first time in a long time we just hugged. After half an hour I got up and gave him a kiss and he told me he was so happy. Why didn't I do this earlier, fuck.
I thought I could I try apologizing properly again tomorrow. I left him the note to read anyway.
I am feeling very hopeful right now and a lot of pressure in my heart is gone. I swear to God and on my own life I will never treat my brother so badly again.
I have been working part-time for the past year and I was saving some money so my brother and my mom could go on a trip to a place he really wanted to go to. But I think I will take my brother myself instead (when I turn 18).
I also realized that I need to have a relationship with my brother where I am not just taking care of him. It needs to be like a normal brother relationship. Like going for movies and stuff. It's going to take some time for me to fix the mess I created though. I'm just lucky my brother is amazing.
I received a lot of messages. I appreciate everyone for their input and I did read them all even if I didn't reply. Thanks everyone.
My actual post:
[Remorse]
I know this will get a lot of hate and yes I deserve it. I am not looking for any validation or forgiveness. I know I am a piece of human trash.
I just need to get this out.
I have a brother who is two years older then me. He has suffered from a condition since birth that forces him to be in a wheelchair anytime he is out of bed. He cannot use his arms that well either.
We used to have a great relationship until I turned 11 and I really started resenting the amount of attention he took from my parents. And how much stress he put them under.
I had to constantly help him, change him, feed him. I hated it.
There was a few years in his life when he so mean to my parents and it really made me resent him more.
I realize now that I had no right to judge him and I will never know how difficult life is for him.
I stopped hanging out with him and made more friends at school. I would tell my family all the fun I was having at school during dinner to make him feel bad.
I started barely talking to him or acknowledge his presence. He would get frustrated to the point of tears to get my attention.
It started escalating two years ago when I would purposely turn off the wifi and unplug the tv every time we had to leave the house so my brother could do nothing but sit in his wheelchair.
I would purposely delete his favorite saved shows on the DVR. I would make fun of his speech. Push things just out of his reach.
I would act disgusted when I had to change or bathe him. It always made him feel bad and he would apologize. I made my own brother apologize for taking a dump. What the fuck is wrong with me?
But my fucking saint of a brother never told my parents. And he never let me have it.
Three weeks ago, he was trying to talk to me non-stop and I was just ignoring him. I got annoyed and wheeled him against his wishes to the backyard and placed him under an umbrella and went back inside. I fell asleep and realized I left him out there for three hours.
When I went to bring him back inside he was in tears and wouldn't look at me. He was humiliated.
I have always felt guilty about how I treated my brother all these years but my anger towards him overpowered it. But seeing that look on his face affected me in a way that was different from before.
I stopped all the bullying after that day. I couldn't even look him in the face I was so ashamed.
Last Sunday my brother told me he was glad I was his brother and friend. I couldn't even respond. I went to my room and cried.
I'm fucking crying again typing this all out. When did I become an evil trash human being? Fuck.
I'm 17 and he's 19 now. I know there is nothing I can do to make up for the past 6 years.
My brother will be returning with my mom from a specialist appointment tonight. I'm going to apologize to him and beg for his forgiveness tonight. I want to start being being a fucking decent brother to him again.
I am a healthy guy with no issues who chose to bully his only brother for something that wasn't even his fault. I am so ashamed of myself.",

confession,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1n5zrdq/i_lied_to_my_pickme_friend_and_she_got_a_tattoo/,32183,1496,I lied to my pick-me “friend” and she got a tattoo based off of it,"🚨🚨🚨UPDATE AT BOTTOM🚨🚨🚨
It’s been about 2 years since this happened-but I just got confirmation from a friend who attended her tattoo appointment that it was because of what I said.
The Backstory:
I (25F) was introduced to Peggy (fake name)(25F) through a mutual friend. She had recently moved in to a friend’s neighboring apartment unit and was quickly introduced to our friend group. Almost immediately, I could tell we weren’t going to get along based off of some backhanded compliments that were given; but I decided that it was too quick to judge her fairly and invited her to a game night that a friend and I were hosting.
Huge mistake.
Game one: Sardines. During a drunken game of sardines in the dark, Peggy faked a fall and pushed my head into a shelf. How do I know she faked it? Because she literally told me in front of everyone and LAUGHED about it saying “I found him first- that’s why I pushed you”.
Game two: Kings cup. Peggy called me out during the “never have I ever” portion for having gone through a divorce. Talking about it normally wouldn’t have bothered me since everyone who was there already knew about it and were really supportive during that time- but it was the fact that she was trying to single me out and shame me for it.
Throughout the rest of the night this kind of behavior continued, and by the end, I was thoroughly convinced she had some sort of vendetta against me. Finding out what -or in my case WHO- it was, took almost no time at all.
One of our friends (who we’ll call Mark) was in attendance that first night. Mark (28M) is a tall, kind, funny, and generally attractive guy. Essentially, he’s catnip for her type. At this time, we were pretty close friends and Peggy did not like that. For the next 6 months, anytime he was around I had to deal with the most ridiculous, awkward, and petty attempts of her trying to single me out or embarrass me.
Now here’s where the tattoo comes into play:
I had been planning on getting a dragon tattoo for over a year. I am fully aware that dragons are a common and trending tattoo, but I wanted it anyways because it was special to me and my mom. I had even worked with my tattoo artist on incorporating her favorite flowers into the piece and figuring out what kind of style/other details I wanted.
About a month before my appointment, Peggy heard a friend and I talking about the tattoo and started asking questions. I swear I could see the moment the lightbulb went off in her head because she grew the biggest sh*t-eating grin I have ever seen.
My lightbulb moment happened shortly after.
When she asked where and what kind of dragon tattoo I wanted to get, I lied. I told her about how much I loved the movie “Spirited Away” (because I do- it’s a banger) and went on a tangent about how I grew up on that movie, how my dad showed it to me, and that, “it’d be cool if he (Haku) was wrapping around my arm or something”.
(If you haven’t seen the movie, one of the main characters is a boy named Haku who turns into a dragon)
Peggy had never seen this movie before, so I encouraged her to check it out and ended the conversation there.
Now, considering she had never seen it before, I didn’t think she’d actually do it. But Reddit. She did it. And it wasn’t just a tiny-cutesy little thing either. She committed to my EXACT DESCRIPTION. The thing is freaking huge🤣😭😭
When she showed it to me two weeks later, I was in shock and she probably thought I was upset for taking something from me. But I went home that night and switched between feeling awful for lying to her and laughing for how utterly unbelievable she was for doing it. 2 years later and I’m still doing that.
I had confessed to a friend recently about my lie and that’s when she told me. She went to the tattoo appointment with Peggy that day. And word for word Peggy had said, “She’s going to be so upset. This is like the exact tattoo she wanted”.
Edit for FAQ:
Regarding the girl who went to the appointment with Peggy: We didn’t become friends until after this all happened. At the time we were only acquaintances and she ended up dropping her as a friend for her own personal reasons after. We discovered later in our friendship our mutual distaste for Peggy, but this also wasn’t the crux of our friendship.
Neither her or I dated Mark. I had turned him down early in our friendship before she came into the picture. Don’t get me wrong- Mark is a catch, but he deserves someone who’s crazy about him and that just wasn’t me. We sorted our friendship out prior to this whole mess, and hopefully he can find a healthy middle ground of crazy lol. He was pretty oblivious to the whole thing, and I didn’t need him to sort it out for me, so he didn’t know until way after.
Didn’t know how to edit a post until now but here you go. Face is blocked out for obvious reasons but I don’t follow her socials so you guys will have to settle for her cropped pfp.
The Haku Tattoo
I’ll keep you guys posted if I have any updates- for now this is just a confession into the void
🚨🚨🚨UPDATE🚨🚨🚨
I finally showed this post to the friend who went with her to the appointment; and she was kind enough to supply a picture of the tattoo in progress.😭
Haku in progress
The crazy thing is- she did this to her too with a tattoo commemorating her favorite music artist😭
From her:
“I initially wanted the tattoo bc he’s literally my favorite artist and so I sent my artist (the one you met) my reference photo and she said she wanted to come bc she was thinking about getting one too. So we get there and he started doing my stencil and stuff and when she saw she said “oh my gosh that’s so cute it would be so cool if we got matching tattoos!” I (being excited and at this point having no issues with her whatsoever) was like yeah girl it’s your body so I just was like okay and let it happen, ig it’s a momento for her🤷🏻‍♀️ She got the exact same thing and exact same placement too”
🚨Final🚨
To the readers who are asking me to show this to her to get her reaction- I don’t live there anymore, so I can’t. I CAN say however, one of her friends found this post and reached out to me on Reddit trying to get me to say my name😅 I didn’t. Since then, Peggy has changed her pfp lol",

My closest Apple store is about 2 hours away and it’s a huge inconvenience for me to drive there not to mention the extra gas. So instead of explaining this to her (she’s the kind of person who doesn’t care about things that don’t effect her directly) I told her it was $329 to fix (which is true if I didn’t have apple care). She wrote me a check for $329 and I only had to pay $29 and I pocketed the extra $300. I consider that my non disclosed inconvenience fee.

He unblocks me every couple of months to taunt me about being left with his child. But there is no child Imao. It's just funny to watch how much joy he gets out of thinking he created a child and disappeared.
Almost like it's a kink for him.
I don't ever plan to tell him there's no child lol. I'm just going to let him enjoy feeling like he did something.
For those calling me crazy— I do have borderline personality disorder. So, it’s playtime 😈
Also, we weren’t using the pullout method. He was using a condom and decided to take it off quickly before he ejaculated and shove himself back inside of me to ejaculate, while I pushed on his chest, cried, and said “no” repeatedly. I didn’t deserve that, but he deserves this. And the fact that so many of you think that lying is worse than or equal to RAPE is fucking terrifying.",

When I worked there they were in the process of phasing out denominational gift certificates. ($5, $10 & $25) 
The way is worked was if you spent more than half of the certificate they gave you the cash back. So if you ordered $5.50 worth of food and gave them one of the $10 gift cards, they gave you the $4.50 back in cash. My manager was in charge of destroying all the existing certificates as we transitioned to the more traditional credit card looking gift cards.
So my manager said he shredded the certificates like he was supposed to, but one night when I was closing I found two boxes of the gift cards tucked deep in the dry storage room. They were FILLED with the certificates that were supposed to be shredded. So, I scooped them up, brought them out to the dumpster in trash bags and threw them away. After we closed, I came back and recovered the back, and brought the certificates home. I counted them. There were 1,000 $25, 1,000 $10, and 500 $5 certificates. None of them had expiration dates. Total haul was $40K in fast food certificates. 
My manager never said a word, he couldn't. He had reported them destroyed weeks earlier.
Over the next three years my girlfriend and I toured every location in our state, and the next 4 states ordering food, and getting the change. We never kept track on a spreadsheet or anything, but we got good at knowing what menu items were just about half.
After the first year, we started saving the change in a shoe box, and let it build up.
I bought my first car for $7,800 cash from the change.
And for some reason A kiddie cone was $1.05, if you gave them a $5 cert they gave you $3.95 back. We threw away a lot of kiddie cones.
Edit:
Holy crap this blew up.  Here are the answers to some of the FAQs
We could hit 10-12 stores in a day if we drove around for 5-6 hours.  Both of us would use a gift cert.  it was not that labor intensive.
The only cameras in the store were at the cash registers & take out window.
The manager has no clue who took them, or at least never treated my differently.
Each gift certificate had a generic PLU on them.  E.i. All the $25 were PLU #756.
When we stopped selling the certificates we were told to keep honoring them because they were pre paid.  They were not coupons.
One can only eat so many ice cream cones.",

Apparently lots of people have strong feelings about the elf. The kids and I had an awesome holiday. We went to Christmas festivals and school programs; they were in a holiday play, we made Christmas cookies and all of the typical holiday joy and not once did we miss the stupid elf. If the elf works for your family, that’s great. And I mean that sincerely.

I haven’t talked about this to anyone (even though it’s been years) even my closest of friends, minus the ones that were there.
One nite when I was in college I was driving to get some liquor for a party my fraternity was supposed to throw the following night.
I was taking a street I was very familiar with to get back to my house.  It was dark but the street was lit with street lamps.  I remember that I looked at my radio for a second, just a second not very long at all.  But when I looked back up to the road  there was a man crossing.
I didn’t have any time to react, by the time I saw him he had already hit the good of my car and bounced off the side.  I remember screaming and hitting the brakes, and the wash of horror of what had just happened.  I’ll admit I had thought about speeding away, but I pulled over to the side and ran out of my car to check on this guy.
When I got to him his family was standing outside the restaurant he was leaving and they were all screaming and crying.  He has laying on the side of the road with blood coming out his nose and mouth. Two other men were standing with him trying to see if he was alright and calling 911.  All I could say was “I didn’t see him” I was frantic by the time it had set in what I had done.
I sat on the curb across from the family and listened to their crying in agony while we waited for the paramedics to arrive.  I sat there and sobbed while to paramedics took him away in an ambulance.  I don’t believe I’ve ever cried so hard and for so long.  The worst part about all of it and what still kills me today was that his wife came over to me while I was distraught on that curb, sat next to me, placed her hand on my shoulder and said “I was married to him for almost 50 years.  We had a good life.” Then she hugged me and said that she forgave me.
After everything was said and done it was ruled that it was an accident.  I wasn’t charged with anything and I had one of my friends pick me up from the police station.  I went down a dark path the years after that.  I drank heavily, dropped out of college in my senior year, and had to move back in with my mother and father because I couldn’t hold on to a job.  Even tried to kill myself with pills.  It was a hard road to recovery (witch I feel I’m not fully recovered from nor do I feel I ever will be the same). But eventually I got my life back in order.  Joined up with the Navy and saw a bit of the world, and now I’m on track to go back to college and hopefully finish what I started there.   It took almost a decade but I finally start to feel almost whole again.  I’m back to hanging with my friends, and actually going out.  So maybe there is a light at the end of the tunnel.
Wow, you guys are awesome! Thanks for the support and feedback.  I’ve never really posted anything on reddit before because people can be assholes, but all these kind words are moving. Thank you!

I was in charge of going through the socks, underwear, bras, shoes, purses, and bedding. Additionally, we would collect brand new stuff and hold them back for a “sale” we would have four times a year with all the brand new stuff. We happened to get six or eight brand new bras and one of my coworkers boxed them up for our sale. At least four months went by between the time we boxed up these bras and the next time I saw them again, so they weren’t new, and if someone had noticed something was missing and came in asking for them back, we would try our best to find their items as long as we could. We never heard anything about them. A week before everything goes out onto the floor for the sale, we check everything over, make sure it’s priced, and price them if needed. These bras in their boxes were something that needed priced and I pulled one out of the box. Behind it was a thick bank envelope with nothing written on it. I opened a desk drawer and put the envelope inside there. I grabbed it when I went on my lunch break, and it was full of cash. After counting it, I realized it was $8,000 and put it in my bag without saying a word to anyone and didn’t tell anyone I worked with until I left there, and undersold how much it was by a LOT, telling them it was a few hundred. I never heard anything about it and no one ever asked anything about the box, so I don’t think the person that donated even knew they did.
Part of that money was used to help me get a car so I didn’t have to walk to work anymore.",

They got back together and got married.","This was back in... let me think, maybe 1997? I was 38 and my daughter was 18, and she was dating Harry, who was 24. I was an alcoholic and dabbled in other drugs, mostly cocaine. I was not a good person, let alone mother. Not like I was abusive to my daughter or anything but I was generally inattentive and cared more about my alcohol and drugs than her, especially in her teen years. I am 14 years sober now.
I disproved of my daughter dating harry, but I never told her why. He would flirt with me, constantly, and the age difference also creeped me out. Also, he was an alcoholic and drug user, just like me. She broke up with him over his alcoholism.
Soon after she moved away, not too far but regardless she didn't live with me anymore. Harry kept calling me and asking if we wanted to get drinks, I turned him down, but then one day he said he had a bunch of coke and I couldn't resist. He came over, we did the coke, and we ended up having sex. He was a very good looking guy. He looked A LOT like that ridiculous 80s justin beiber picture that was on the front page today, that is actually what made me think about him.
For the next few months, maybe like 3-4 months, he would sometimes come over and we would have sex and do drugs and get drunk together. Any drug addict knows what that is like to have a drug addict buddy in that way.
Then I got pregnant. I knew it was by him, I had sex without a condom a few times stupidly. I never told him I was pregnant, and I went and got the abortion and kept it a secret.
Anyways, I stopped seeing him after that, it was too weird. I also got sober, for like 4 months, before relapsing. Fast forward 2 years and my daughter contacts me and tells me that she got back with Harry, and that he is fully sober. I was mortified honestly. He was gonna tell her that we slept together, and she is going to hate me for life. They came over one day and said hi, and when my daughter was gone, Harry told me that there is no reason to tell her about what happened. I agreed.
Its been 16 years of marriage on their part. They have a kid together. Harry got cancer, then beat it. I got sober. That's basically it.
I don't see them very often, they live in texas and I live on the east coast. But whenever I do there is always that tension between me and Harry, its literally the first thing that comes to either of our minds, I can just tell. Not like sexual tension, like ""why did we have to do that? What the fuck is wrong with us?"" kind of tension.
I think about this often. Especially when I see my grandson. I always think that could have been my son if things had gone differently, but WOW what a disaster that would have been if I decided to keep that child.",

I'm writing this as a confession because I don't know where else to speak about this and I don't want my kids finding this out on my main account.
My friend died a few months back due to heart problems. He was taking care of himself so it was a shock to everyone. Especially his wife who was with him at their house when he died. Due to this she decided to move somewhere else and because she and her daughter were still distraught she asked me to pack up his stuff.
He had some boxes in his basement and after a while I started feeling nostalgic and decided to look into them. I found pictures of us from when we were kids all the way to before we got married. That was enough to make me feel bad and I just got back to taping them up.
But one of the boxes seemed to be in much better condition, so I decided to check it in case it was something important. To my surprise I found out pictures of him and my wife from when we used to hang out together, as well as more recent pictures from family reunions. The most recent being from my wife's birthday party.
Alongside the pictures there were letters that he never sent her. The first one dated 2 months before I met her. The last one was also the same date of her birthday party. There was one that stood out the most was one from after I started dating her. He wrote that his time had passed and since my happiness was as important as his own he would watch over us.
I'll keep his box safe since it isn't my secret to reveal.",

In the early 80's, ATM's had a feature called ""deposit with cash back"". It was a check cashing feature but for some reason it ran on the honor system. Of course, this feature went away, eventually. But I figured out that if I just put an empty envelope into the ATM and I didn't seal it, I could claim that the bank lost it. So the ATM would cash the check then a week later the bank was like ""uh that envelope was empty"". For whatever reason, Bay Bank let me get away with that.
That summer my family stayed in a cottage in Hyannis for two weeks. During that time, I opened savings accounts at 5 different banks, using the rented house address. They mailed me ATM cards within a few says. I deposited with cash back on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday and early Monday. Back then the limit was $400. and they were going to check the ATMs by Monday so the scam would be over.
I scored 10,000 1984 dollars. No one ever came looking for it. I was never questioned or arrested. I don't understand why or how. The only thing that happened was the FDIC had me on a list of people who banks shouldn't do business with. I didn't even find out about that til I was 21, five years after the crime. I was in college and tried to open and bank account and no bank would let me.
40 years later, I have a bank account, and nothing ever happened. It's the only time in my life that I had good luck.
Of course, I blew the money. Back then it was enough to put down on a house or easily bought a car.  I spent it on girls, weed and beer. It was fun but I wish I was smarter.",

This is a regular enough lunch for her because it's her favourite one. Even though I already know, I can't wait for her text to tell me what she thinks, that woman makes my heart so warm.
Edit: she texted me, she loved her wrap ❤️",

I've been trying to lose weight for years now, and while I have had some results, I am still technically clinically obese, though not morbidly.
My sister is also obese, but is closer to morbidly obese than I am. Yesterday, I went on Instagram and her profile popped up, so I decided to scroll through it since I haven't seen her in almost 5 years and don't really look at my family members' social media. As I was scrolling, I came across one of her selfies and was hit with the realization that her face is my face. I had never realized just how similar we looked, but her selfie was the same face I see in the mirror everyday, and I'm horrified. I know it sounds awful, but my sister has always been the ugliest of the kids in my family, so realizing I look at all like her is not particularly pleasant.
I realized that one of the reasons we look so similar was because of our face shape, very round and pudgy. Seeing her and realizing how ugly I think she is and realizing how similar we look has given me extreme motivation to lose the weight and keep it off. I can't do anything about our facial features without surgery, but hopefully by losing weight I will be able to think that we look different and won't feel so awful about my appearance.
Anyway, I know that I'm an awful sister for saying so bluntly that I think my sister is actively ugly, but it's true. And it's not just her face, she also doesn't take care of herself, has hair that's been overdyed and is stringy and gross now, and recently got several face piercings (you can have your own opinion, but I think they're ugly 99% of the time). I'm probably going to see her in just over a year, so I really need to lose the weight by then for fear that anyone will comment on how similar we look.",

It was around 11 PM, and I had just gotten home from a late shift. I live in a small apartment in a not-so-great part of the city, so I’m always a little on edge when walking home. That night felt… off. As I was unlocking my door, I noticed a guy standing at the end of the hallway. He wasn’t doing anything, just standing there, but something about him made my stomach drop.
I got inside, locked the door, and tried to shake it off. Not even five minutes later, someone knocked. Hard. I froze. It wasn’t my neighbor (she texts before coming over), and I don’t really have friends who drop by unannounced.
Then, a voice - “Please, can you just let me in for a second?”
It was a woman. She sounded out of breath, almost panicked. I looked through the peephole, and there she was, maybe mid 20ish, wide eyes, glancing down the hall like she was being followed.
I know, I
know
, stupid move, but I cracked the door open just a little and asked her what is going on.
She whispered that there’s a guy, he’s been following her since she left the train. She didn’t know where else to go from there. That’s when I realized. The guy I saw earlier...
My heart was racing, but I stepped aside and let her in. I locked the door immediately, turned off the lights, and we just stood there in the dark, listening. A few seconds later, heavy footsteps passed my door. Slow. Like someone was looking for something. Then… nothing.
She stayed for about thirty minutes, just sitting on my couch, shaking. I offered her water, and we barely talked. Eventually, she called a friend to come pick her up.
When she left, she just said thank you and disappeared down the hall. I never saw her again.
I don’t know if she was telling the truth. Maybe she was genuinely in danger. But I think about that night all the time, and I can’t decide if I did the right thing… or if I got really, really lucky.",

AMA","I was born in America but spent my childhood in England. I hadn't the best home life so when I turned 18, I left England and moved to America. I had a small bit of money from birthdays and a part-time job. I got a server job in the US and was scraping by. The restaurant was an up-market spot and I still believe I only got the job because of my English accent.
There was this lady and she'd come in often. Sometimes with her partner or her friends and even on her own sometimes. She used to give the biggest tips. She'd always ask to be served by me if I was working. She'd get me sit down and chat. She'd ask mostly about me. Where I grew up etc.
One day, she rang me. Apparently she my boss gave her my number and they gave it. She said she'd like to offer me a job. I was curious so we went to a cafe [coffee shop] and she said she'd like me to be her house's houseboy. She explained it to me. It was like chores and almost like an emotional support human for her. Her partner would be gone a lot.
I spent about 5 years in the role. She was mid 40s at the time and by the end of it we had such a close bond, despite me sort of breaking up her relationship (but his own fault). She was always really generous. I don't regret it. I enjoyed it and it's set me up for a much better life. I don't really tell people about it, though.

If someone actually tries to  do anything all I’m supposed to do is lock myself in the security office and call 911. The only work I actually do is telling people not to have sex in their cars in the parking lot which happens way more often than you think and the nightly system audit that I have to run. The audit takes 30 minutes to an hour so for the other seven hours, I just smoke weed and watch movies. I know for a fact my boss doesn’t care because he told me he was high on my second day of training. He was even the one who told me I could just watch movies or whatever when it was slow long as I checked the cameras periodically.

We're laughing and says ""we've never before and we will probably never meet again,  so can I tell you something I need to get off my chest?"" I say sure and she confesses that she had a years-long affair that ended about 2 years ago.  I smile and say that's not uncommon and not so bad.  She then gets very serious and says that's not the bad part. He recently died of cancer and she so wanted to see him before he died but she couldn't (her husband actually knew about the affair, but his wife never did).  She was on the verge of tears saying she couldn't even go to the funeral, but she did go to his grave afterwards.  She couldn't talk to her husband about it, she couldn't talk to anyone. I wanted to ask her more questions,  but she stopped me. She got herself together and left to join her husband.  Before the evening ended she talked to me again, with other people around. Big smile on her face saying what a great fun conversation we had.  She asked to exchange numbers, which we did.  She started texting me 2 days later, giving me a bit more details about the affair, explaining that she really loved the guy and missed him terribly. And then told me that her marriage was miserable and that she believes her husband is really gay.",

With medically complex kids you fix one problem and create two more.
She lived 11 years. It was probably 9 years too long. She lived most of her life in hospitals. Literally months at a time. She would sometimes be home a week or two and then end up back in. I don't think she ever spent more than two consecutive months out of the hospital in her entire life, until she went on palliative care.
She was more comfortable in the hospital than anywhere else. How sad is that. She was the ""warrior"" kid. That was her whole identity. Making cards for her nurses and decorating her medical equipment and being Tough with a capital T. That was all she had. Never went to school, not in any meaningful capacity. Never played a sport or an instrument. Never had any real friends to speak of. Never had the health to take up any real hobbies. Just an entire life made up of surgeries, shots and nurses and fucking medical equipment to decorate. I gave her a pathetic life.
There wasn't a single intervention I wasn't willing to put her through to buy more time. She was the happiest, most accepting kid I've ever met but in the last six months she was done. I refused to listen. She asked me over and over again if she could just ""stop"". I would push until she shut up and went along with what I wanted. Why did I do that. She wanted to make me happy but she knew she was done. Selfish. She died incredibly agitated and upset. I think she was scared to let go because she knew what it was going to do to me. I wasn't strong enough to let go. I'm so so sorry.",

I work remotely at a very large fortune 50 company, Monday through Friday, for 40 hours a week. At least those are the hours that I’m “on.“ Starting around noon every workday, I take a one and a half to two hour lunch break. I purposely block off my calendar with “busy work“ so no one questions what I’ve been doing. I honestly cannot find enough hours in the week to be able to do half of the stuff that I need to be able to get done, because that’s just part of my job. There is a ton of project management and follow up with various clients. But that’s just about everyone on my team. 
For some reason, my boss has never questioned me or been suspicious of anything. My intuition tells me that he might do the same thing himself on his remote days, although he has a hybrid schedule. And that’s not all. 
I have taken vacations before during lighter project weeks, where a lot of communication isnt required between me and my team. I took my laptop and logged on during mandatory meetings and then logged off right afterwards. I know there is a lot of talk out there by corporate CEOs saying return to the office is mandatory because of stuff like this, but I always hit my goals, I do everything that’s asked of me, and I exceed expectations every year during my performance review. Honestly, this is the first time in my career where I feel like I have a “normal“ work/life balance. I feel like this is what work really should be. 30-32 hours of core work, while enjoying life the way it should be enjoyed. Some of the happiest moments of my life have been playing with my toddler son and watching him grow up during my lunch hour. Sorry, not sorry.",

I’m a 19 year old non religious woman who just really dislikes being around other people. I also have a lot of friends/ colleagues who lives in the same area as me that I often see at bus stops, shops etc. To avoid being recognised by people, I usually wear a niqab, (face and body covering veil) whenever I go out to run errands. I usually wait until no one is at the same street as my house before I leave, as it would seem weird that a random woman in a niqab would regularly leave or go into my home. Though I do get stares since I live in a non- muslim country, it is still very common for women to wear hijabs in my city, and you do see a woman in a full coverage veil sometimes. Even though I get stares, I feel so much more comfortable knowing that no one can actually see or recognise me.

Our whole family doesn’t talk to her. She’s done things in the past you wouldn’t believe. So she left our lives years ago. Recently she returned out of the blue at my moms house. My mom has 2 other sisters and a brother. My mom and aunt never got on. My mom is a lovely person but she could sense from a young age something was off about her sister, so she kept her distance.
My Aunt was nasty and would hurt people’s feeling intentionally for no reason. She never had a partner or kids. She isolated herself from everyone. My Gran cut her off when she tried to steal thousands of dollars from her. We all genuinely think there’s something physiologically wrong with her.
So back to where I was going with this....one morning I was at my moms house. Just chilling out and there was a knock at the door. So I opened it and there she was. She walked in, she looked like she had took drugs. She looked dead behind the eyes. I tried to stop her but she pushed me down. I honestly don’t know why she came to my moms house out of everyone. I quickly got up and she went into the kitchen she startled my mom and punched her in the face, my mom didn’t even have a chance to blink before she hit her. She went down like a ton of bricks.
My heart felt like it had been sucked through into my stomach when I seen it. Something came over me, I don’t know if it was anger or adrenaline, but I ran up behind her and grabbed her hair and I dragged her out onto the back lawn and I bashed her face about 15 times, blood was everywhere. Thankfully no one seen me or I might not of been writing this right now. I got up and I left her there. I went to check my mom, she was in a lot of pain. I looked back out the window and she was gone.
We told our family immediately about this and they were perplexed and angry as to why she just turned up and attacked my mom. I’m still so hurt and angry as I write this. But I also feel tremendously guilty and upset that I done that to her because I’ve never fought anyone and I’m not a fighter at all, but something came over me and I snapped.
I can’t get over it for some reason. It just seemed so unreal and there was no reason for the attack. God forbid she had a weapon that’s truly scary to think about. We didn’t call the police. As I assaulted her badly and didn’t want it to bounce back on me. That’s another thing I feel ashamed about.
But should I feel bad or not? I need others opinions as I’ve been bottling this up for a while.
My Gran was devastated, she just wanted her daughter back but from a young age she took to drugs, spent time in prison and amount of other things. You can’t help someone who doesn’t want to be saved.",

Apparently in NYC, they weren’t allowed to actually refill the cup for health code reasons or something. So they’d throw out the cup and give you a new one. That’s when I realized there was a loophole here.
I kept five cups and brought them home. Then I started bringing one in the morning to Starbucks and I’d get a free “refill”. I’d do this every day and I’d end up with 5 gross paper Starbucks cups at work and then I’d bring them home on Friday and repeat the next week. I did this for months, not paying for coffee at all, until one day I brought in my cup and handed it to the barista for a refill only to realize that all of the cups behind the counter were different. It was getting close to the holidays and they’d switched to their holiday logo cups. Well, color me embarrassed. I started paying for coffee again after that. It was a good run though.",

I tried talking to them, telling them my boyfriend and I work at a coffee shop and bakery and our hours were really early. I bribed them with treats I made.
They were constantly opening their windows and playing their music so loud for hours at all hours. Even their conversations were loud. With their windows open, even with mine closed I would know when their mom was visiting, when their boyfriends weren’t texting them back, or when they got their nails done. I did everything to cover it up. Music of my own, fans for white noise, tv, etc. it’s like they knew when I was actively trying and stepped up their game to be louder. Eventually we tried talking to landlords, made noise complaints, everything. They just learned how to be sneaky about being loud. Eventually it got spiteful. Putting music in the window, screaming and banging on the walls. Our houses weren’t connected but there was maybe a max of 10ft in between with a sidewalk going through. I was getting really stressed out. Losing sleep, couldn’t relax in my house, was getting sent home from work because I was so tired. It got really bad and I had no idea what to do. Nothing we had done up to this point had worked.
When I’d explain my situation people would come up with funny revenge ideas. None of them stuck like the skunk tincture did to me. I could feel it in my bones it would work. So I ordered some on amazon and one morning as I left for work I dumped it all along the side of their house that they keep the windows open on. It smelled so bad I was worried I was gonna get some on me and I’d smell bad at work. I didn’t.
Fast forward a couple hours and I get a notification on our camera that there’s motion. It faced in between the two houses along the sidewalk, the place I dumped the tincture. One of the girls was walking back and forth up the sidewalk spraying the rocks under the windows with Lysol. I watched it for a while and more came out. One opened the window and pulled the screen off and wiped it all down. Eventually a maintenance guy showed up. Then the gas company. I kinda started to panic at that point. I felt kinda bad, like maybe I had gone too far. I don’t think they ever figured it out or suspected me.
For the next 2 months those windows stayed shut and I barely heard anything from them. It was so peaceful. I couldn’t believe it worked.",

I didn't realise until I worked in care how rude, arrogant, entitled, nasty, racist, homophobic some elderly are. Out of all 80 plus only about 8 are actually decent. They are so disgustingly rude it's unbelievable and this is even the ones who are non dementia.
Dementia crowd are a different breed. Some of lovely, some are the most awful people I've ever met and before you guys go crazy and scream but it's their dementia!!!! Yes. Some of it. But there's still a human being under the dementia and there's no way calling one of my black colleagues a monkey, n***ga, wog and specifically attacking them for being black (or our Indian ladies) is new to them. That's been there for decades. One guy looked at one of our new african sponsorships and said ""get back on your banana boat and fuck off""
They treat us younger people literally like we are their maids, barking their every want at us when they can see we are busy. They hurt us, berate us, go out their way to make our job more difficult. One lady (non dementia) threw her dinner plate with her dinner on at me because I got her husbands sugar wrong in his tea.
I was targeted and attacked my entire pregnancy. Zimmer frame to the stomach, punched in the stomach, spat at, had a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher sprayed at me when I was heavily pregnant, told I should be ashamed of my mixed race baby. One new entry came in and only lasted 4 hours before his previous care home was called to take him back as he chased me saying he wanted to kill me and my baby. I've had shit thrown at me, my hair pulled, dirty nails dug into my skin and scratched.
Another guy threatened to rape my younger colleague which really upset her.
They're just vile. I'm sick and tired of saying we need to respect our elders and they're sweet little innocent cuties. There's some really nice ones sure! And I absolutely love doing care with them. But the others are just so nasty.
Edit: just an add on.. in my experience schizophrenic people (medicated) are the sweetest people ever. We have a gentleman who is on injections each month and he's a HUGE guy. Big, muscly, 6 foot plus. He's in his 60s and he's so lovely and often tries to protect female staff from other male residents. Our schizophrenic ladies have their moments but generally are really kind and really intelligent too.",

I was 15 and my friends were 14 and 16. I was away at another friend’s house one night. When I came back the following day my mom told me she had kicked them out because the 16yo tried to make a move on my dad. She absolutely slandered that poor girl’s name.
When I got into my 20s it still sat in the back of my mind. I just knew I didn’t get the truth. So I reached out to the 16yo who was also now in her 20s. We met up and I got the true story. I could see the pain in her eyes. She said she’d been in therapy for years because of my father. That he did it in such a loving way, it really fucked her up. She told me they’d been drinking on the property then went skinny dipping. All while my mother was in bed pregnant with my sister. They made their way into the house and upstairs. Where eventually my mother walked in on them. I let her know I had her back if she ever decided to do anything about it.
I am now in my 30s and recently became a mother and it’s all I’ve been able to think about. They still don’t know that I know the truth. It’s reawakened the rage in me. Especially all of the teenage rage they made me shove down for so long. Because if anyone did that to my daughter, or if I caught my husband in that situation, HELLLLLLL NO. It was easy to shove down before because I learned from the best, my parents. But becoming a mother, especially to a daughter, I’ve never wanted someone to pay for something they’ve done so bad.
I feel like if I brought it up to my mom she would just get angry and talk shit. She’d probably say the past is the past and I need to let it go. That people can change. But I know he hasn’t changed due to events over the recent years with his anger and control issues. He’s a very big narcissist who believes he can do no wrong whatsoever. And my mother is so far up his ass. It makes me wonder if the 16yo was his only victim. If she was, and if he’s never done it again, would that be okay? Is this forgivable? Because I don’t feel like it is.
I want to tell the whole family, but I feel like they’d just downplay it and make me seem crazy. Cut me off and turn my siblings against me. They’ve done it before when I called them out on other things. So, here I am. Just needing to get it out I guess. What would you do?",

She was complaining about her drink while one of my coworkers was making the drink. As soon as she got it she accidentally “spills” it and asks for a completely different drink. I was so fed up. She wanted a Frappuccino. She went to the bathroom while we were making the new order. I switched with my coworker and made the drink. Instead of almond milk I made the Frappuccino with regular milk. The drink was ready by the time she left the bathroom. She takes the drink and takes a sip and didn’t complain. 5 hours later she calls the Starbucks from the hospital and I was the one who picked up. She got in a car accident trying to rush to a bathroom. She said she shitted her pants. I couldn’t be anymore happier that she was safe but got her karma.",

I got clean at 21 years old after years of abuse. I got married at 26 to my amazing and beautiful wife. She knows I was an addict.
I spent all these years not even really thinking that much about the concept of relapsing. It had been
so long
. I still thought about it, but with marriage and my kids and everything the thought of it was just so ridiculously out of sight to even consider trying it again.
3 weeks ago, it was my friends birthday. He is 4 years younger than me so of course he wants to go to some cool hip sketchy bar/club thing in bushwick.
I got drunk, really drunk. I hadn't really drank much at all in the past few years so my tolerance was way lower than expected. There was a dealer outside and a few other junkies nearby. I don't even fully remember what happened, I just remember going with them, abandoning my friend at the bar (it was like 1am anyways), and going to some apartment and shooting up. I spent the night there, then all the way until noon the next day. I had 10 missed calls.
I panicked when I came out of my daze. I told my wife I had gotten way too drunk and was puking and my phone was out of battery so I stayed at Charlies house. She was disappointed I didn't tell her but also thought it was funny because she used to tease me for not being able to handle my liquor. This was a ""I told you so"" moment, she had told me not to drink too much before I went to the bar. She wasn't even in new york, she was at a summer house with the kids in Massachusetts.
I spent the next 4 days until they got back just... riddled with anxiety, urges to get more heroin, horrific mind zaps (I dont even know what to call them). It was, in some ways, worse than my withdrawal symptoms when I first was an addict. Not because of the physical feeling, but the horrible mental feeling of what I was possibly giving up, my wife and kids. I wanted to fucking get more so badly. I left my house to find heroin 4 fucking times. 4 times, I gave up to get more, but wasn't able to find any and snapped back to reality and went back home. I still thank FUCKING GOD I did not somehow run into some street dealer during those 4 times. I would have absolutely done it.
I feel like everything I thought about myself, that I was strong, that my addiction was behind me, that I had beat heroin... it was all gone. I am not going to say I am back at square one or anything, I am not. But I feel like something inside of me has reset. My unwavering strength against addiction was broken at the slightest temptation. I still am weak. Heroin is so, so much stronger than me. Its truly unbelievable how much stronger it is than me.
When I was young, my aunt had cancer. She beat it. Then it came back soon after, and she beat it again. It didn't come back, and we loved how strong she was for fighting her cancer and that she had overcome it. She lived with us. I remember her feeling of strength after her 2nd year of not having cancer, her 3rd year, her 6th year.... it finally felt like it was gone for good. Her thinking ""its finally behind me now, its a part of my past"", and then it just fucking came back. 9 years after her first diagnosis, it came back and killed her. I remember her feelings and how she felt about it. So many years after she thought it had gone away.
That is how I feel. Like a cancer which I thought I got rid of a decade ago just showed back up on my screening.
The first 5-6 days after I tried it that time outside the bar were the worst. My kids and wife have come back. The urges mostly went away the second I saw my kids. I hugged them so damn hard.
And I never told my family what happened, nor will I ever. My wife never understood that side of me, she met me 5 whole years after I was clean. I just cannot have her know, ever.
I won't do it again. I am planning on not drinking to excess like that again, except maybe in very specific situations like at the summer house where there is no option of drugs. I mean, not like I WANT to get drunk again like that, but just in case I ever want to get loose? I am never doing that in the city again.
I am still about 90%+ sure that I won't ever touch heroin again. I am still positive in myself about it. Its just... it used to be 99% sure. That is what fucking terrifies me.
I said heroin is stronger than me. It is absolutely stronger than me. But the reason I won't ever do it again is that it isn't stronger than my family, my wife and kids. I don't care about how good it feels, I will not subject my wife and children to me being an addict. I would rather just kill myself than that.",
confession,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/9cptbm/8_years_ago_i_caused_a_ufo_panic/,17607,441,8 years ago I caused a UFO panic,"One college summer break 8 years ago my friends and I were bored. We remembered a demonstration from a high school science class of a ""Solar Balloon"". This was just a really thin black plastic bag you'd fill with air, seal, and then set out in the sun. The sun would heat the air in the black bag and the bag would become buoyant and float.
We had the idea to find the cheapest/thinnest black plastic trash bags available and combine a bunch of them to make a huge balloon. We spent a few days driving around to Walmarts and dollar stores trying different brands to find the thinnest possible plastic bag and thinnest tape which would work the best. Finally we took a number of them, cut off the bottom ends, and taped them together into a huge balloon which we filled up with a leaf blower and then tied the end. After sitting out in the sun for a half hour or so we had done it!
This is a picture a friend had taken as it was just becoming buoyant.
We had to mess around with how the tape was sealing the bags to use as little of it as possible as the weight of the tape added up and made the balloon harder to float.
Shortly after this the balloon got away from us
Further
This was dissapointing, but we made another one and got funny looks from cars driving by and were entertained for a bit. Shortly after that this new balloon met it's demise smacking into a tree and getting popped. Oh well, mission success.
A few years later
I happened across this news article
. The balloon that got away had apparently blown a town over and caused a big UFO panic. People were calling 911, the police, and local radio stations about it. Our boredom unintentionally created a UFO panic in central NJ. I moved out of the area but when I get together with my friend we always bring this up and have a good laugh.
EDIT: Wow didn't really think this would gain much traction. Also didn't expect any NJ Redditors to have seen this let alone the author of the article to show up. Glad everyone thinks this is funny but that being said please don't go out and do this on purpose.

To gain more freedom I worked hard to start my career as a 3D artist, and I was making a couple hundred every few weeks at best during most of high school.
Even with how little I made compared to how hard I worked; my mom and stepdad would pressure me to chip in for the groceries and mortgage payments. Keep in mind, we aren't poor or anything, we were middle class, and they just wanted more financial freedom for themselves so they can consistently go on luxury vacations.
I also have a few siblings (now in the higher years of high school) who they also do the bare minimum for, not bad enough to where it's child neglect but definitely not great parenting considering none of us could focus on our studies while having to work.
The creative industry is difficult and unforgiving, and I put blood sweat and tears into my work to get where I am at this age. I'm not going to let them pressure me into making any big contributions to their finances so that they can keep going on excessive vacationing sprees.
Only me and my girlfriend know how much I really make. I have been saving tens of thousands of dollars without anyone else around me knowing. One day they'll find out how much I have, but for now I will bide my time and take advantage of as little financial burden as possible. Once they do, I'll simply move out and be done with them.
EDIT: Thanks a lot for the advice and comments everyone! Just to clarify, I do of course take care of my own expenses and my siblings' (since I wouldn't want them to be overburdened like I was) - I am not pitching into the household bills because they don't deserve it.

I knew I needed to do it at school when there were cameras and witnesses and no one could accuse my parents of anything sinister, so I waited for a day when I knew one of my teachers would let me leave mid-class to go to a different floor.
I threw myself up the stairs, tore a bunch of cartilage in my elbow, shattered my growth plate in my wrist, and got an eye doctor appointment! I was already an injury prone kid (ADHD spacial awareness for the win, this did not get massively better unfortunately lmao), so no one questioned it.

Since I started High School, my parents stopped checking in on my grades and their mentality was basically ""we don't care as long as you get into a good university"" and they've carried on this mentality to when I got into college and they didn't really checked on my grades and gave me free rein as long as I majored in the subjected they wanted and graduated on time with good grades. Well basically what happened was that I failed my first year and had to switch my major. I didn't tell them and they didn't ask so I thought as long as I got my shit together and not drop out I'll be fine. One day out of the blue last semester my dad asked me to write up a resume. I panicked and wrote up a resume but changed the GPA and major and made up some shit and thought I saved myself. Welp, this winter break my dad dropped it on me and told me he knows people in a big company, he gave them my resume and everything and wanted me to intern there. So I am fucked.

confession,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/atmizg/i_snooped_on_the_ceos_email_account_and_got/,17029,420,I snooped on the CEO's email account and got myself unfired,"A couple years out of college I worked as an analyst at a pretty small private equity firm. The CEO was one of the biggest assholes I've ever met. He was fairly young in his 40s, a multi millionare, and the type of guy driven solely by money with 0 business ethics. He'd do anything to get the upper hand in a deal regardless of who it screws over...contractors, employees...I even saw him seriously fuck over a long time family friend of his without any remorse.
Anyway, aside from my analyst role, as it was a really small business (only about 20 people in the office, and then a bunch of people working remote), I also happened to be one of the only semi technology-literate people in the company. So like many of my generation, I became the defacto ""Millenial Office Computer Guy"" too. Despite my lack of qualifications I got put in charge of handling pretty much anything minor tech related. Setting up servers....fixing laptop issues...answering ""How do I convert this to PDF"" questions...even basic network security. They thought I was some sort of computer genius...but really I was just mostly winging it, Googling pretty much everything.
But eventually I got legitimately pretty good at all the tech stuff. They gave me bigger tasks like planning all of the computer systems for their owned businesses, and supervising installs. I didn't get paid extra for any of this mind you.
After a couple years of serious bullshit working there, I was pretty worn out. I wasn't progressing. I hated working for captain douchebag...he treated everyone like shit. I was pulling 12-14+ hour days with no overtime or performance bonus. And they weren't paying me nearly what they should have. I also hated being ""the tech guy"" and was depressed as fuck basically living in a cubicle. So I decided I full on had enough of the 9-8 life working for assholes....and I would start my own consulting business working for myself.
However, instead of quitting right away, I figured it would be smart to first build up my client base on the side while I was still getting a steady paycheck. So thats what I did. I launched my company, and landed my first clients.
As the workload increased, I slowly started spending more and more time working on my side business while at my office job. At first I was pretty low key about it. But eventually, it was blatant. As it was a super small company....I was the only one who knew how to do a lot of important tasks and operate some key internal systems. It was easy for me to tell my boss a project was taking a whole week to complete, that I actually finished in 10 minutes.
Pretty soon I was spending 80% of my day working on my own stuff in the office. I'd even take calls for my side business clients at my desk. The rest of the time I was usually dicking around on Reddit or something. Of course, we had systems in place to monitor network activity. But I was the person in charge of monitoring it.
This continued for a while. As my own business ramped up, I cared less and less about the office job. And since I hated waking up early, I began rolling into work late. At first it was only 30 minutes or so. Then it progressed to an hour. When my boss didn't reprimand me...it became clear how much they needed me there. I took full advantage of this. Before long I was arriving around Noon, working for a couple hours, then heading home.
My coworkers werent happy, but I helped them with all of their tech problems and they hated the company too, so they kept their mouths shut about it. My boss eventually said something to me about all it at one point, but I just came in on time the next few days and then went back to coming in whenever I wanted.
After more than 2 months of coming in 4-5 hours late, and working on my side business in full view of my asshole boss, I couldn't believe I wasn't fired yet. I deserved it and felt it was inevitable.
On a hunch, I decided to do a little investigative work. As I was the ""tech guy"", I also had full access to the company email server. So I logged into the CEO's personal email account, and searched for my name. Lo and behold, there was a recent email thread between him, my direct boss, and some other team members with my name in the subject line. Obviously I open it. They're discussing my recent performance issues...the last email in the chain basically said ""If nobody has any objections, I will be terminating him at the end of the week"". 2 days from then.
I wasn't surprised, but I decided there was no way I was going to let these assholes fire me. Although I didn't give a shit about that job, I didn't want to have a termination in my work history. I also wanted to keep getting paid for a while longer. Of course, I couldn't let him know I actually knew I was getting canned. So, I formulated a plan to perform a little inception reverse-psychology mind fuck on the CEO.
The next day, one day before they planned to fire me, I requested a meeting with him to ""discuss my current performance."". In that meeting I sat down, and he asked me what I wanted to talk about. So I told him (paraphrased): ""Look, I know I've been a shitty employee lately. I'm sure you've noticed. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I've been kind of getting the feeling you guys are planning to let me go soon."" When I said that the shocked look on his face was priceless...he must have thought I was psychic to work that out on my own the day before it was going to happen. I remember him just saying something like “uhh"". I continued while he sat flabbergasted. ""So I'll be honest with you, My heart isn't in this job anymore. As you know, I'm an entrepreneur at heart...which I’m sure you can relate to. I want to start my own company. However, as you're aware, I have a lot of responsibilities here nobody else can do."" I then proceeded to list all of the things I did and projects I was working on. I could see it on his face when the realization sunk in of how screwed he'd be if I left suddenly.
""So here's what I propose. You don't fire me. I don't quit. I keep working here for a month, finish my current projects, and train whoever you want on everything I'm in charge of. After a month is up, I will continue to come in once per week until its complete. After that, if you still need me...you can pay me on an hourly project-by-project basis"".
I intentionally mentioned the possibility of me quitting so he could feel like he ""won"" the negotiation, even though I technically had him by the balls.
He paused to think for a minute, then said something along the lines of: ""Okay. You have a deal"".
So, not only did I get myself unfired...I actually turned the company into a paying client. During that month, I continued doing pretty much whatever I wanted since I had an expiration date (while training my replacement as promised). After the month was up they hit me up regularly for remote task work . I charged them triple what I was earning while working there, and barely had to deal with the CEO.  my client base was big enough I dropped them for good.
...after all that, the CEO still calls me up for advice/questions nearly 3 years later. These days I just blow him off saying ""Sorry, I'm too busy"".
Edit:
As it seems there’s some doubt that this actually happened (it did), figured I’d clarify a few points.
1) This was a very small company. The office had about 20 people in it, and several dozen more worked remote. If you’ve never worked in a small office before, I can assure you it’s pretty normal for employees to wear many hats and take on random roles outside their initial scope. It’s also pretty normal for them to be severely lacking with network security and controlling passwords.
2) I did not become some “computer genius” and never claimed to be (tho my company of technology illiterate baby boomers sometimes thought of me that way). I had decent basic working knowledge coming into the job, and picked up more over the several years I was there. For anything complicated (like wiring, hardware installs, advanced networking tasks etc) we hired outside IT consultants. But I was the guy who would source them, hire them, supervise them and learn the systems they put in place. And I just handled more basic tasks myself . We’re also not talking about enterprise level security here either
3) my consulting business has nothing to do with private equity. Im not going to reveal exactly what I do for privacy sake since this blew up, but it’s in marketing. I didn’t steal any of my old company’s clients when I left and don’t compete with them**
4) yes, Im fully aware and admit I was an asshole, hence posting this in
/r/confession
. In fact I decided to start my own company because I hate working for other people without my own skin in the game. I’m not a great employee when I don’t care about what I’m doing. However, the guys running the company were pretty shitty people, and I did not feel that bad about it at the time.
The thing I did have reservations about was snooping on the emails. I do not condoned invading privacy like that. However, he’d freely given me the passwords (so I could help him set up his outlook, forwarding, etc), and I felt me getting fired was inevitably coming soon.",

I picked it up and I remember wanting to give it back, but I was there to get Yu-GI-Oh cards (I had recently lost all my good cards to my friend in a bet) so this was a miracle of sorts to make a solid come-back. So I kept it, I thought the woman had left the store so I went to go purchase my cards, right as I gave my money to the cashier, she walks up behind me watching me buy my 100 dollars worth of Yu-GI-Oh cards (this isn't a normal thing to do). She said nothing though and I left before she went to go buy her items so I didn't have to see the look on her face when she realized. There is no doubt in my mind that once she realized she was 100 dollars short, she would make the assumption it was the kid in front of her in line who spent 100 on cards.
I just want to say, I am a different person now :)",

Two days ago I returned to work because I’m a lawyer and I just couldn’t take time off like that and was already late and had so much work to do, but earlier today my ex came to firm and gave me a folder filled with unsent letters that my daughter wrote to me and said she found them in her room and wanted me to have them.
And I waited to get home to read them because I knew I’d sob if I read them there and wouldn’t be able to work, and I’ve been sobbing nonstop for four hours now, I myself used to write her a lot of letters and messages that I’d just throw away.
She wrote about how embarrassed she was when she requested to not see me again and how she still loves me and how she wants to reunite with me and go on a trip and how she wants to meet my new wife and kids and she was wondering if I still love her and think about her like she does and she wrote about wanting to become a lawyer like me and that she was studying law and was wondering if I would be proud of her, she even wrote one after her ex boyfriend cheated on her and how she wished I was there and she was clearly crying because there was stains on the letter and that just broke my heart in a way that I didn’t know was possible.

[REMORSE]
When I was around 14 or 15 I found my older brothers Reddit account because of a secret santa package that got sent to us. I of course wanted to snoop onto his account so I checked his history, and found all of his posts for the past month had been been to
/r/depression
One post mentioned how my family, including me, were out of town due to me playing sports. That was the night he said he would finally commit suicide. He mentioned either pills or knives and it still haunts me to this day. I was obscenely scared when I found this post, and was home alone and vowed to myself to never let anyone know that I found this. To this day, my parents do not know, and have tried to keep me in the dark about his struggles with mental health as much as they can, and my brother most definitely does not know. The only person who knows is my now long term girlfriend, and now you guys. I feel awful for never telling anyone in my family, and I feel like this has taken a toll on my own mental health, which in itself is not in a good state at all.
I just want to thank whoever dissuaded my brother from commiting suicide that day. He doesn't know how much of a positive impact he's had on my life, and you kept him around so he could further that impact.",

We separated (but never officially divorced) in 2020. I truly loved living alone with my pets, but am admittedly not the best housekeeper. Laundry is always piled up and the dishes don’t get washed until I can actually fill the dishwasher. I don’t sweep/mop as often as I should, but will make a generous effort if expecting company.
So back in 2022 we reconnected and rekindled our relationship, and decided to move back in together. His OCD (which I have recently learned to call it) is extremely frustrating. He MUST wash or sanitize his hands after touching anything that’s been on the floor, money, his wallet, etc. I am required to do the same. Any piece of clothing that has been worn outside of the bedroom (ie. his “safe space”) even if only for an hour, has to go immediately into the laundry.
He hasn’t had a legit job in over a year. Some under-the-table work for a while, started two different server jobs and was fired within a few weeks. I work full time and pay at least 90% of the bills (this was still the case before we split). So for the past year I decided that if he is gonna be a SAHH I’m not going to do the housework.
Guys, our house is disgraceful and I’d be mortified if anyone came to visit. The floors haven’t been cleaned in months. The garbage is overflowing before it gets taken out. Last week we got a notice in the mail about our unkempt lawn. I cave in and clean the bathroom when he leaves skid marks in the toilet or when the sink or shower starts looking gross but I legitimately can’t tell if he just doesn’t notice these things, doesn’t care, or just knows that eventually I’ll take care of them so he won’t have to.",

confession,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/950fmp/for_three_years_i_switched_my_partners_tea_in_the/,15362,786,"For three years, I switched my partner's tea in the morning because I couldn't deal with his fake snobbery.","When my ex and I started dating, I used to make him a morning cup of tea as a cute gesture and it stuck for the three years that we were together. It's a nice small thing you can do to make someone's day and and it's a nice way to get to know how someone likes things doing. So, my morning tea used to be any old teabag (Yorkshire tea if it was on offer), a splash of milk, and the first cup always had a teaspoon of sugar; every cup after was just tea and milk. My ex however had to have a very specific ritual: Thompsons Punjana tea, a teaspoon of milk and absolutely no sugar. He was adamant that he could tell in a heartbeat when his morning cup of tea and at the age of 33, he's never liked any other tea other than Fortnum & Mason's Royal Blend.
So, in the beginning when he would stay at mine, I entertained this notion and used to make his morning tea the way he liked: Thompsons Punjana tea, a teaspoon of milk and absolutely no sugar. He would always thank me and tell me that I make the best cups of tea and it was nice, three times a week didn't kill me and it was a sweet gesture. Fast forward three months when he would spend nearly everyday of the week at mine (but not moved in), he was very demanding of his morning ritual and being a student, I couldn't keep affording to buy that brand of tea; besides, what was wrong with PG tips or any non-branded supermarket tea? Tea is tea after all. So, I used to always make his cup of tea with any tea bag, a teaspoon of milk and no sugar. I was always sure to only make it when he was in the shower or still in bed so he could never catch me out and initially, he was dubious and was always asking to make sure it was Thompsons Punjana tea (he used to call it by it's full name to emphasise how good it was). after a few trials of different teas, I finally found that sweet point where he couldn't taste the difference. I would drink it with him and as he sipped, would go on about how you can taste the quality and that there is really no other tea like it.
When we moved in with each other, it was a lot harder to disguise the fact that I was keeping the same box of tea and just filling it with regular tea bags so I had to be a bit more clever. At the time, I was studying at college so I was in control of weekly food shops and only really wanted to go twice a week to minimise costs so we had more to spend on meals out. I used to buy one bag of his tea and two bags of mine a week and kept them in the drinks cupboard. When it came to making his in the morning, I would take one of his teabags and put it in my pocket, giving him one of mine instead and I used to give my tutors at college his tea to drink during the day. He would always comment that I run out quicker of my tea bags because of the quality and that with Punjana, one bag is enough for a considerable amount of time; little did he know. This went on for a couple of years and I never told anyone about it out of fear that he would find out, as after all, he really couldn't tell so why ruin the fun? It was saving me money and it was sort of amusing. I never let him make a cup of tea unless I was away so he never really had to find out.
After we split up, we remained good friends and I've spent some time with him too in our old flat. Every time I visit, he always asks me to make a cup of tea the way I used to for old times sake because everyone he's been with or dated after me can never ""make it taste the way I did"". He even says that when he makes it himself with Punjana that he could never make it taste right and that I was some sort of special tea maker. I still haven't told him.
This is a long post about tea so the TLDR: ex used to play on that he was very fussy with tea, I switched his morning cup to a considerably cheaper tea bag and he could never tell the difference and still can't.",
confession,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1nhl84h/i_edited_a_yearbook_entry_and_never_told_anyone/,15235,317,I edited a yearbook entry and never told anyone about it,"this happened during my last year of high school, and I’ve never told anyone about it. I was part of the yearbook committee and we had this tradition where seniors would write short texts about each graduating student. Most of them were sweet or funny, but I noticed one entry that really bothered me: there was this guy in our year who wasn’t part of the popular crowd and had been bullied throughout high school. Yes he was a bit weird, but he was never mean. Someone had written what looked like a nice tribute to him on the surface, but it was full of cruel undertones. They made subtle digs about his crush, mocked his outfits/style, and included other meanspirited jokes that only made sense if you knew the context of how he’d been treated. The submission was anonymous, but I could tell from the email address it came from one kid that always tried to make jokes to be popular. It just felt so cruel to me. Like a final last kick while he was down before graduation. So.. I changed it. I didn’t rewrite the whole thing, just edited out the mean parts and made it neutral and kind. I was careful not to make it overly glowing since that would have seemed suspicious, but I made sure there was nothing hurtful hidden in there. When the yearbooks came out, no one questioned the text, and as far as I know, the guy never knew how close he came to being publicly humiliated one last time. I never told him what I did and I never told anyone else on the committee. honestly, I’m not sorry about what I did even though I wasn’t allowed to change the submissions. Everyone deserves to have their high school years end on a decent note. I still think about it sometimes and wonder how he’s doing now
Edit: Maybe to clarify something: I know this is not a horrible confession, but I felt the need to share it with someone. I know I officially did something against the school rules, which was not legally right, but like I said I don’t feel bad about that. I wanted to share this here because, honestly it’s easier to tell strangers on the internet than people I actually know. It happened over a decade ago, and bringing it up in real life would just be awkward for me to the people I know today. Like “Hey, there was a kid at my school you’ve never heard of. Well, here’s this thing I did back then.” Plus I didn’t keep in touch with anyone from those days. I was one of those shy kiddos who liked to fly under the radar. I’m expecting my first kid and that has especially got me thinking a lot about how kids treat each other. I already knew back then that it was wrong how this guy was treated, because it wasn’t his fault to be different from others. He was quite nice, just socially pretty awkward and didn’t fit into the group dynamics of our year. I’m not proud of never saying something in person and only having the guts to do something when I could hide myself in a group and then escape to college
Edit2: and thanks for all the kind words and awards! I’m happy I decided to share this story. The comments have been interesting to read. So many of you opened up about your own rough times at school and it’s kind of sad how many people have these memories.",

Edit: this was 3 or 4 years ago and I’m currently in an amazing relationship with a very kind man. Thanks for all the support so far guys it means a lot. I’ve come a long way but man, those days were rough. I do feel a tinge guilty about how I reacted, so I appreciate you guys here giving nothing but love.
Edit 2: Wow was not expecting this to blow up. For those of you saying I need help, trust me I get that. I was in a very dark place at the time. And I was VERY drunk while doing all of this. I ended up going to rehab and am happily sober now. My life has IMMENSELY changed for the better and I handle things way better now!
Edit 3: For those of you wondering why I “let the ex off easy”- honestly I should have guessed he wasn’t that into me. I just wanted him bad and deep down knew he was using me for a place to stay/food/my car/etc. I got myself into that situation. It was a really rough time and I had literally 0 self respect. What really broke my heart was my best friend betraying me like that. I did kick the ex out and he was homeless/without a car/etc so he didn’t get off easy that’s for sure. But at the same time the pain from him cheating was absolutely nothing compared to the realization that I lost my best friend.
Edit 4: also I realize my title was very confusing and long winded lol. For those confused, I’m a female. My roommate was a confident gay male. I didn’t know the guy I was dating was in to dudes
Edit 5: I apologized to my old roommate and vice versa. We are both in better places and good friends again. I forgave him and he forgave me, this charade was years ago and we have moved past it
Okay last edit: To whoever gave me gold, that’s so sweet I honestly did not expect this reaction. It’s my birthday today and I’ve had a great time reading all these comments so thanks Reddit. You guys rock",

Probably the only place I will ever say this","Not using a throw away because I hate myself I guess. Last night my friend and I went to a concert an hour away. We got there early and decided to get something to eat. We shared some spicy Korean fried chicken and a panini.
We get to the concert, and about an hour in… I thought the smell (a straight up sausage and bell peppers smell) was my friend burping or something?? a little while later, the smell comes again. I’m confused. we were talking, she didn’t burp, so I’m like, ok someone else around is probably burping or literally eating bell peppers LMAO. The smell was so random and brief, but so consuming. Time passes, the smell appears once more, she says something along the lines of “I keep smelling bell peppers” and I’m like “oh my god me too???” We had a laugh when we were able to finally hear one another leaving the theater, and head home. All is well. 
Writing this now, the day after. The smell was me. I just farted, and yea. I was shocked lmao. Spicy food can upset my stomach sometimes, and tbh I don’t think I even fully noticed I was slipping out farts at the function because I was so overwhelmed, and when I did discreetly let one out I did not imagine it was that smell somehow?? 😭
So yea. Went to a concert, goofed on the potential gassy queen. I was the gassy queen all along.
EDIT: to clarify, since you guys wanna be mean lmao
I didn’t explain what I meant well. I do not have a “loose butthole” 😌
I was not thinking clearly bc I was overstimulated. when I tell you I truly was sooooo sure it could not be me producing the smell bc it didn’t even smell like a fart. my brain was just dissociated so I wasn’t putting 2 and 2 together that the smell was me, which sounds dumb, I’m aware, but it’s what happened lmao. I knew I was farting, it was just an afterthought. Do you really remember every time you fart?
I know bell peppers aren’t spicy, I never said they were. I said the fried chicken I ate was. I didn’t even eat bell peppers. I have no idea how my fart smelled like that

That direction was toward traffic. My roommate and I went down and helped him to the taxi and scolded the driver for being so rude. I made the mistake of giving the blind neighbor my phone number so that I could give him a ride in the future.
Then the phone calls came... and never stopped. And when I gave him a ride, he would ask for various detours. I'm very calculated by nature, if he had told me beforehand where he wanted to go, it would be cool, but no... we'd be driving along and he'd throw in 2 - 3 extra places on each ride. And it came to be every day that he wanted rides... and he'd even call me to remind me to give him a ride, not that was ever late or backed out.
Finally I had enough, so I gauged how blind he was. His response was that he was ""blind as a bat"". A week or two after he said that, I told him I had a job interview in the next city. A week after that, I told him I got the job and was moving away in a month. After I ""moved away"" It was strange as hell walking by him in silence as he stood on the sidewalk.",

A year into the job, I receive a meeting invite on my calendar from someone who I recognized as a VP in my company. I didn't know any of the other attendees, but I show up to the meeting. I take a seat in the corner of a large table. As I'm sitting there, a message pops up on Teams from the VP saying, ""I'm gonna talk about
such and such
, and when I call on you, I want to you say
this and that
."" I did exactly what I was told. Afterward the meeting, the VP pulls me aside and says, ""you did great!""
I started getting more invites like this. About once a month, I sit in on some meeting to listen to my execs talk about business contracts with our clients and customers. Sometimes I showed a demo of our software, but most of the time I just didn't say anything. I took some notes that no one ever looked at or asked to see.
I was at the lowest level of the totem poll. I have no reason to be at these meetings. The bigwig at my company told me that he just ""wants me to be aware of the business"". Whatever that means.
A few times, my company flew me to Dallas, New York, Orlando, and elsewhere to quietly sit in some meeting. Once, I got to eat dinner at a fancy restaurant in San Francisco with all these strangers who had more money than god as they talked about golf and business contracts.
One time, a client starts talking to me about some real-estate thing I had no understand about. He asks what I do for the company. The VP answers on my behalf before I can even get the words out: ""This is [name], she's our lead technology strategist. She ensures our business priorities align with our tech."" The client accepted that at face value. I smile and nod along with the VP's brazenly confident bullshittery.
I was now certain of the true unspoken reason for my presence: they liked having my pretty face and soft-spoken voice in those meeting. I'm a smiley, upbeat, bubbly, and extroverted person in real life. Maybe they thought my feminine wiles would disarm and pacify our business partners into a more agreeable business deal.
I understood my role in these meetings. Despite that, no one ever made a comment on my physical appearance or attractiveness. I was never sexually harassed on the job. They treated me with absolute professionalism.
In 2021, my employer was acquired by a bigger fish in the real estate market. My office was made redundant. I moved on to greener pastures.
I am still a computer programmer. But maybe I should have gone into sales instead.",

They were there, specifically, to observe me.","I’ll never forgot the time two grown women were introduced to our class as 'observers' for the week—“they’ll be in the back watching me teach for a few days. In order for them to do their job properly, please ignore them! Act like they’re not here.”  They sat silently in the back taking notes on their respective clipboards for an hour or so each day. On that Friday, my teacher keeps me back during recess, telling me the two women want to chat/ask me some questions. I was then placed in a chair directly facing them, with my teacher and her aide standing off to the side a few steps behind the duo.
Something was up.
They then proceed to tell me, delicately, why they’re here. They go on to explain that my teacher knows I’m a good student and so my recent failing test grades don't make sense. They then show examples of me spelling the same words, or doing the same math accurately on previous tests/assignments, yet completely wrong with recent ones. “Have you been failing these tests on purpose?”  This was the first time I experienced that heart-beating-out-of-my-chest type feeling. For one, it was TRUE, I was faking it. On top of that, they seemed VERY serious, scary serious, especially to my 8yo self. I, shamefully, admitted that yes, I had been. And when they asked
why
— well, that answer (the truth) led to my first (non-parental) authoritative-scolding on memory.
Simply, I did it because I was jealous of the kids who
seemingly
got to have a second recess  There was group of 20 or so students across the six 2nd grade classrooms who got pulled each week for roughly half the day. One day I saw them playing outside from inside the classroom. They appeared to be having soo much fun, and I wanted in on the fun. So I asked one of them how they got put into that group and was told, “because I’m bad at spelling and math”.
Ugh, my two strongest subjects. What am I ever to do?
Dumb myself down, of course! To become one of them, I had to act like them, think like them, test like them.
After our lil’ interview sesh, my failed attempt at manipulation - whatever you wanna call it - was never discussed of again.

It turns out that at the end of the road, the things that really mattered were good times with friends and family, And these were almost all in the kitchen.
I've gotten to be relatively old, and finding out what I have certainly was not a happy thing, but given the number of my friends over the years that died with no notice from a heart attack or vehicle accident or whatever, this weirdly seems like a bit of a gift that I know what's coming and have
some
idea of a timeline. Although not a really good idea.
Go home make yummy food and have your friends and family over. Actual happy memories are all that matters, money, power, status, everything else is mostly all nonsense.
Edit
This outpouring support and sympathy is more than I could ever have imagined! Thank you all I really appreciate it; However in the
immortal words of Monty Python ""I'm not dead yet""
8-)
Right now I only have major annoyances but no show stoppers.
I plan to continue enjoying family and friends and cooking as much as I can, it's just harder and slower now because the surgery kind of wrecked my left side. On the other hand[terrible pun intended] I'm right handed,  so I can still do a lot of stuff, it just takes longer.
PS if any of you are cooking for anybody that has cancer and has no appetite, I can tell you from first-hand experience that
the banana bread
goes down really easily and sits really well.
The weird part about all this was that I initially found it and made it for someone else who had cancer about 25 years ago, And now we make it for me.
I also can't express enough gratitude that due to the efforts of friends I've never met all over the world the things that made me happy during my life will continue to make others happy for decades or maybe even hundreds of years in the future. The internet which is the very definition of ""not permanent stuff"" is now the eternal keeper of the things in life which mean the most to me which were food and friends and family.
Please note that I have read and appreciate each and every one of your replies. I have not answered them all because doing things online while missing large chunks of my brain is quite a bit more difficult than it used to be. But know that I read them all and you're all appreciated and I thank you all.

WE HAVE RECIPES.
Yesterday's post
Okay, so, I very quickly realised from comments and PMs that there are A LOT of people here on tight budgets who struggle to eat well due to depression. And a lot of self-help advice requires more energy and motivation than people with depression actually have.
So, I actually went and did it. I've made a blog dedicated to NOT cooking. It's called
""Fuck It, I'm Not Cooking""
.
Nothing I ever post will take more than five minutes to make, nor require any more preparation than chopping things and wrapping a tortilla. All of it's cheap and healthy, or healthy as long as you don't overdo the condiments. I've made a ""master shopping list"" so you only have to shop once a week, don't waste much food, and should be able to carry it all home if you don't have a car. Everything's inexpensive and easy to find in the supermarket. There'll be both sweet and savoury recipes, snacks, and healthy alternatives to cravings for crappy food.
Basically, it's supposed to be as much/less effort than your usual depression eating, taste good, and be way better for you.
I've spent all day setting it up, from tomorrow there will be recipes daily. So far, I've posted a few super basic recipes in with the Master Shopping List.
Here's the main page:

Here's some commentary on how and why I made it

I've had enough of people trashing American Chinese food as ""not the real thing"" or even worse, ""Chinese food dumbed down for American people"" (like WTF?!)
While I don't deny that Chinese food in America is different from Chinese food on the mainland, that  doesn't make it any less worthy. Sure, it has been changed to some extent to suit local palates, but that's pretty much the same thing with Chinese food in the diaspora in general. There is also Indonesian Chinese, Filipino Chinese, Singaporean Chinese, and even Peruvian Chinese  food-yet nobody calls these variants as ""fake"" or ""inauthentic"".
Moreover, people had to make adaptations to the cuisine anyways in the new land due to the lack of available ingredients that they usually had back home.  No Chinese broccoli? Use western broccoli instead.
One has to remember that Chinese cuisine is by no means a monolith- it's pretty diverse with a lot of regional variations-hence Beijing cuisine is different from Shanghai cuisine and Cantonese cuisine. A lot of early Chinese immigrants to the US were from the Guangdong province, hence American Chinese food is heavily based on the cuisine from that area (albeit still a limited representation).  This is the reason why later immigrants from other parts of China might find American Chinese cuisine to be strange and completely foreign.
I always have to chuckle whenever someone tries hard to demonstrate what ""authentic"" and ""inauthentic"" Chinese food is by comparing a Chinese takeout dish with Cantonese origins (ie, chow mein or orange chicken) to a dish from another region in China, which is essentially comparing apples to oranges. A good example would be this
Buzzfeed video
in which the host claims to try ""authentic"" sweet and sour pork for the first time, when in reality the version that she tried is no less ""authentic"" than the one she is used to. Only difference is that the so-called ""authentic"" version is another regional variation, just like the Cantonese-style sweet and sour pork many are familiar with.
While I do appreciate people willing to take a deeper look into Chinese cuisine beyond the menu at the local takeout, there's no need to be an utter snob about it. Food is food, peeps. It's high time that we recognize American Chinese cuisine as something unique of its own.
EDIT: Holy smokes this thread did blow up unexpectedly. I'm seeing a lot of amazing input from various perspectives. Here are a few additional things I want to add
1) While I did mention American Chinese food in the post and title, I was also referring to Chinese food in the western diaspora in general (including Canadian Chinese food, British Chinese food, etc.)
2) Regarding authenticity, yes it is something that does exist, though at the same time it is something that is very subjective. Given the insanely diverse array of Chinese cuisine, it would be disingenuous to pinpoint ""authenticity"" as solely one way of cooking. There's no such thing as ""this is the only way to do it right"". Take Kung Pao chicken for example. While the original version in Sichuan is hot and spicy, there are also other regional versions in China that are less spicy.
3) Some of y'all also talked about how some people bash American/Western Chinese food out of an identity crisis- this especially rings true for a lot of second gen Chinese Americans grappling between two cultures. On one hand, American Chinese food has been looked down on for a very long time due to the perception that it is greasy, sketchy, unhealthy, etc. A lot of second gen Chinese Americans might feel ashamed to be associated with this kind of food, so they overcompensate by going on full board with the authenticity train- trying hard to prove that Chinese food is more than just the takeout menu. A much as I detest the culinary gatekeeping sentiment, I can definitely see where it's coming from.
4) I also find it interesting how a lot of people think of American Chinese food as generally heavy on the grease, starch and sugar. While I do get it's kinda explainable given that general tso's chicken, sesame chicken, and orange chicken are some of the most popular American Chinese dishes, there's also way more to that as well. Heck, even American Chinese cuisine can be vast and diverse! Of course there's also a lot of less greasy, less sugary foods like moo goo gai pan and moo shoo pork. However in my state, Louisiana, there's also yakmein and crawfish fried rice. Let's bring on the goodness!",

I made an Italian wedding soup.  Usually I sub in a can of Cannellini beans.  It’s quick, it’s simple, it’s tasty, the internet told me to.
But my wife bought special beans.  What makes these beans special?  Probably the fucking marketing, but they were on the shelf, dried, in a small plastic bag touting the wonderful properties of beans.  She bought them at a bean store in San Francisco.  Only in SF could there be a fucking bean store during a pandemic.  Great fanfare was made over this package of beans.
We soaked them for like an hour, tossed them in when we’d normally toss in the can of beans.  Cooked another 15 minutes, and served.  They were… crunchy, but the broth flavor was really good, so we figured “meh, eat this bowl, let it keep cooking.”  Kinda like slightly undercooked rice, you know?
I did not know.
My wife’s sister went first.  There was unexplained running during a movie.
My wife went second.  Two down.
I’m now sitting on the couch by myself with the pets listening to my brother in law make pterodactyl noises with distant cough/vomit sounds in the background from my wife and sister-in-law like a gross harmony.
We’re out of toilets to puke in.  I’m feeling about a 7/10.  I have yet to determine if time is a friend or an enemy for me tonight.
Turns out, dried beans need to be soaked for 5 hours, then boiled, and always eaten very tender.
Thank you for this final lesson 2021.  “Purging the past” jokes are being received poorly by all those involved.
Anyways, it’s 9:30 here.  Happy new year.  Here’s to fucking 2022.",

What's going on?
A recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app
permanently inaccessible
to users.
On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from
Apollo
to
Reddit is Fun
to
Narwhal
to
BaconReader
.
Even if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface
.
This isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free.
What's the plan?
On June 12th,
many subreddits
will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away
permanently
unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because
we love Reddit
, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.
The two-day blackout isn't the
goal
, and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action.
What can
you
do?
Complain.
Message the mods of
/r/reddit.com
, who are the admins of the site: message
/u/reddit
: submit a
support request
: comment in relevant threads on
/r/reddit

know by simply spamming their modmail.

The label on the quarter wheel was clearly incorrect, saying that it was .42 pounds, and so was only $10.92. When I went over to the register to see if they would let me actually purchase it, it rung up as it showed on the label, and the cashier let me buy it! When I got home, it weighed 23 pounds! At $25.99/pound, that's $600 of cheese for only $11! I'm planning on giving a lot of it away to friends and family. I've cut it into ~1 lb chunks, vacuum sealed them, and split them between the fridge and freezer. What recipes should I make with my haul???
TLDR: Got an incredible deal on 23 lbs of parmesan cheese for only $11. What should I make?
Edit: photos
https://imgur.com/a/23-lb-cheese-AEZcewy
Edit 2: To be clear, during the check out process the cashier was very aware that this was an absurd price for this large wheel of cheese, and had no qualms about ringing it up as it is. Also, if you look at the website for Murray's Cheese, you will notice that they are absolutely not a Mom & Pop shop, but have hundreds of locations across the USA.
Edit 3: To add some context, I actually arrived at the register without the cheese, and when the cashier asked ""anything else?"" I made a joke about ""not unless you'll actually sell me that quarter wheel of cheese for $11!"" She said ""bring it over!"" so I did, and when it rang up as $11 dollars and I was in shock, she made multiple jokes about it being 11 million dollars. As multiple people have stated in the comments, NY has a law that requires stores to sell their merchandise at the labeled price.

McDonald's.  I don't eat fast food very often, but I do like a good quarter pounder with cheese now and then, supersize the Coke and fries and to hell with the pearl-clutchers.
Breakfast cereal.  Sure, sometimes the hippy-dippy Seven Whole Grain Colon Blow Quinoa Explosion stuff is fine if you add some fruit, but I'm Generation X; gimme a couple bowls of Captain Crunch Oops All-Berries.
Hot dogs. I don't make a steady diet of them, but gimme a simple hot dog in a bun with chili from a can, diced onions, and yellow mustard.  Awesome.  Gimme three, actually.
Milk.  I have no curiosity about raw milk, I don't need your authentic, hand-strained, teat-to-table beef milk.  I just drink whole milk.  I never, however, drink skim milk.  Which is water, that's lying about being milk.

The first is using a chicken stock cube (Knorr if I’m feeling boujee, but usually those cheap 99p a box ones) in my pasta water whilst the pasta cooks. It has the double use of flavouring the pasta water, so if you’re using a splash for your sauce it’s got a more umami, meaty flavour, and it also doubles the tastiness of your pasta. Trust me.
Secondly - using scissors to cut just about anything I can. It always seems to weird people out when I cut up chicken thighs in particular, but it’s so good for cutting out those fiddly veins. I could honestly never go back to cutting them up using a knife.",

To me, they've always been rather plain, but that seemingly was never a problem before. Something has changed, though I'm not sure what.

I've never had to season ground beef before, but maybe that's where I've gone wrong? Is there a secret burger society I'm not privy to? A bovine illuminati?

It was just a late night rant. After sleeping on it and rereading it this morning I do realise I could have possibly used a slightly better tone here. I stand by what I said 100% but I could have possibly done it without insulting people. Apologies if I have upset anyone.
I'm going to point out at the start here that I think and hope that I am not talking to the majority of the members of this sub if you do nothing else just read the links provided, you don't have to read my rant
I posted an off the cuff comment in here recently replying to someone in the UK who was asking what they should buy at a Chinese supermarket. I said MSG crystals because they genuinely are essential in Chinese cooking. I got downvoted for it which doesn't bother me apart from the fact that this is a cooking sub and debunked racist conspiracy theories shouldn't really have a place here.
It genuinely did start with a hoax, it s complete bullshit. I am going to hope (probably in vain) that the idiots will read the links as I'm not going to do their homework for them but I know they won't.
I'm writing this for the idiots, so I'm discounting the fact that most of you vaguely intelligent people realise that glutamates are naturally present in a hell of a lot of food (apologies again for the rant), let's just imagine for a minute that tomatoes, cheese, mushrooms and meat don't contain glutamates. I mean they do and all you sufferers eat this stuff all the time but the minute it's a little Chinese tasting you have a reaction.
It's a genuinely ingrained racist reaction and you should as members of cooking sub that celebrates cuisine from all over the world be disgusted with yourselves (talking to the idiots again).
MSG is a fantastic additive that everybody should have in their kitchen, it is no different from adding a pinch of salt to your cooking, not just Chinese food, it adds a depth to tomato sauces, cheese sauces, fried chicken. It truly is fantastic stuff.
Anyway, as I said, apologies for the rant, I'm sure most of you understand the benefits of it, this is just for the small coterie of idiots that still cling to this ridiculous theory.

My wife's friend came to stay the weekend and being as she's vegan she cooked for us. The food was really good.
I wanted to learn more and bought some Beyond Meat patties they were surprisingly similar to texture to a well done burger. I tried Beyond Meat at a fast food place and it tasted like an overseasoned paste that left regret on my tongue for the rest of the day.
Vegetarian foods in America try to replace meat. MorningStar is never going to replace a prime rib with black beans. But it won't stop them from trying.
This is in direct contrast with asian foods (the other half of my heritage). Where vegetable dishes seem integrated into cultural norms. Hinduism and Indian food for instance. Or Thai foods, Chinese foods have vegetables take up the entire dish. These foods also are heavily influenced by auxiliary tastes. Instead of the beef talking, its aromatic spices and insanely hot peppers.
I'm making sweeping generalizations. But I wonder if it's possible to create foods that are not simply lesser imitations of what you really want (fake chicken nuggies) but a mainstay dish. And if it is possible to make it simple enough for an American pallette and accessible to cooks who don't have much time. Maybe there are and I don't know about them.
TL;DR Is it possible to create true vegetable focused dishes in the USA that arent trying to replace meat as the star of any given meal.
Edit: Thank you for your thoughtful replies and rewards. I'll try to get to your comments!
Edit 2: I want to say I do not think that vegetarians are trying to substitute meat for everything. My vegan guest certainly didn't do that and didn't throw tofu in everything to attempt to cover for meat.

Like, «you stole our spices and now you butcher our food». But I think people are judging him on the wrong premise. I don’t think making authentic dishes has ever been his point. Most people in the UK are very normal working class people with poor diets. Whose worlds are their local communities, and they do what they can to get by. And these normal, busy people are Oliver’s target group. He’s a champion when it comes to public health, and his goal is to get the public to make their own food and eat healthier. For them, chilli jam and soy sauce is probably exotic enough. So adding soy sauce to a dish makes it «Asian». Because that’s how it is to the people he’s speaking to. Had he gone full authentic, it wouldn’t have served the purpose at all, as nobody would have bothered. His shows aren’t meant for British Asians with a strong knowledge of the cuisine of their country of origin. And I don’t see how that’s offensive or wrong.
I’m a massive foodie, and I would never go to Jamie if I wanted to learn how to make for example pad thai. Cause his recipes aren’t meant for that, they’re not meant for foodies who want to spend an entire Saturday making the perfect dandan noodles

Second, adding a splash of soy sauce to chocolate desserts.

Something about the umami. My friends have been trying to figure out my ""secret ingredient"" for years.

When I served it, my mom didn’t know I had followed that specific recipe. But as soon as she smelled it, she froze. She looked at me, confused, then smiled softly. I watched as her eyes welled up with tears. She didn’t even need to say anything, I knew that smell had brought her back.

Every time I watched a cooking video where the cook added lemon juice to a hearty soup or a pasta sauce, I cringed. “That can’t be good…” I thought.
I was a fool.
Today, I was making a Turkish-inspired lentil soup, one of my favourites. Well, I accidentally burned the onions and garlic. Only slightly — not too much — but definitely just enough to be noticeable.
The cheapskate that I am, instead of tossing it and starting over as I should have, I rolled with it... which turned out to be a big mistake. The bitterness was definitely there.
Panicked, I looked online, and learned that apparently, lemon juice
can
offset some of such bitterness. Desperate, I added just about a tablespoon of freshly squeezed lemon juice, and simmered it on low for a bit longer than I usually would.

A proposed new rule would allow poultry plants to process diseased chickens. That’s the last thing Americans need.,"Consider the decision last month by the agriculture department’s Food Safety and Inspection Service to allow poultry plants to process diseased chickens for human consumption.
In July the FSIS approved a petition from the National Chicken Council requesting that slaughterhouses be allowed to process broilers infected with Avian Leukosis — a virus that causes chickens to develop cancerous lesions and tumors. Inspectors would no longer be required to examine the first 300 birds of each flock for signs of the disease, and processors would be able to cut off tumors and lesions and then process the rest of the bird. The approval has led to a proposed rule change that is now before the food safety administrator Paul Kiecker.
Here’s what we know about Avian Leukosis: A small percentage of birds (less than 1%) are diagnosed with the virus each year, but it spreads quickly through flocks and tens of thousands of chickens are condemned annually due to exposure. While it’s unlikely that the virus could transfer from chickens to humans, it’s not impossible. There is some evidence that workers exposed to birds infected with the disease in the U.K. have developed antibodies, indicating a transfer of the virus from animal to human.

And even then, if all you can afford are dollar store spices, that's ok, it still works, and really, it doesn't make thaaaat much of a difference. Add some acid and salt and you're good to go.
Edit: the snobbery of saying only food using fresh ground spices is good is what I'm taking issue with. Not everyone can afford a blender or coffee grinder, or even have the space for it.  Cooking should be accessible to Every One. And they shouldn't be shamed for not being able to.

What is a ""1 medium onion"" (my grocery store literally only carries 'jumbo' yellow onions unless I buy a 5 lb bag)?
When a recipe calls for ""1/2 cup fresh sage leaves, finely chopped"" does it want packed leaves or lose leaves? In general, due to the order I assume this means ""Get 1/2 cup fresh sage leaves then chop them"" but there is a big difference between ""1/2 packed cups"" and ""1/2 loose cups"".
I know not everyone has a scale (especially a sensitive scale) but why can't we just say ""1 medium onion (about 1 cup or 100 grams)""( no idea if that is a good conversion or not just using a example).
For the most part, it probably doesn't matter but sometimes I really would like to have a weight so I can just tare the scale and start adding the next thing.

I'm mostly talking about in ""professional"" recipes (i.e. ones that people are paid to write). If you post something on reddit/your blog I don't really mind (and I don't mind overall to be honest it's mostly an annoyance).

You also have the opposite extreme, where people rate a chocolate chip cookie recipe 1 star (or complain that they would rate ""zero starts if they could""), and it turns out ""all they did"" was sub eggs with flaxseeds, used vegan butter instead of the real stuff, and replaced flour with almond meal--and they wonder where they went wrong.

So I’ve decided to tell the truth to my friends once I baked a great replacement recipe to give them as a make-up. They won’t buy the Alsa batter mix because of the palm oil in it, and I shouldn’t either tbh.. I’ll keep you updated in the cooking sub 👩‍🍳
I’ve really dug myself into a hole. It all started at this event where we were supposed to bring a cake. I had totally forgotten, didn’t have time, so I grabbed one of those ready made cake mixes, like Alsa (maybe its a French brand idk ). Of course, I didn’t dare admit it was just a box mix(edit not a box mix, but a already made batter) , since the whole idea was to bring something “homemade”… But then the cake was such a hit. Like, such a hit that ever since, people keep asking me to make my “famous” chocolate cake for every birthday, every party… 
This has been going on for years now. Everyone keeps begging me for the recipe, and I’ve tried a million times to recreate it with recipes I find online, but the result is always so disappointing compared to that cursed mix. And now my friends are getting annoyed at me for not sharing the recipe, cause I keep saying I will.
So please, I need help figuring out how to reproduce this chocolate cake. On top of everything, the mix is ridiculously expensive, and I’m tired of wasting money and lying to my friends!
Édit3: here is the actual list of ingredients 
Ingredients: Palm oil, EGG 21%, sugar, cocoa powder 18% (sugar, cocoa mass, cocoa and low-fat cocoa powder, natural vanilla flavor), WHEAT flour 10.3%, a stabilizer (glycerol), powdered CREAM, powdered EGG white, a pinch of raising agents (diphosphates and sodium carbonates), a little salt, and a preservative (E202).

I'm now a shadow of my former self. The sauce added so much flavour and depth to what I already thought was a delicious breakfast... it blew my mind...
It is now IMPOSSIBLE to enjoy food without some kind of spice. I genuinely feel unsatisfied if food doesn't have some kind of kick. The average restaurant experience is now ruined. Bland food genuinely upsets me now and I look down upon people who have not been 'awakened' to the point that I have had arguments.
I talk about hot sauce in my sleep. I fight strangers in the street.
Last night, making love to my wife, in the moment of climax instead of screaming her name I screamed out  'HOT SAAAUUUCE'. She is now leaving me after I said her porridge was bland.
I have lost control and it's all the Hot Sauce's fault.
At least I'm not a Tottenham fan though, things could be worse...

It was kind scary. During dinner time, she said “well you are not a big eater huh”. I mean, how could I be a big eater with that weird overcooked salty food?
I was invited again, to make dumplings together. I brought dumpling skin (from a market, I can’t make them). She said she’s going to make the skin, I was excited, I haven’t had fresh dumpling skin for years.
It turns out she bought a tool on Amazon, thinking that would work, obviously she doesn’t know how to use a rolling pin either. The skin was so thick, also sadly not holding the fillings inside.
I kinda took over and said let’s use the store brought skin, here are the fillings I made. The dumplings turned out pretty great, then she started to invite me over every weekend to “cook together”, took me a little while to find out I became her family’s free weekend cook.

The book sets out not to be a list of recipes to make, but to teach you how to cook with what you've got. And it succeeds.
Basically, it teaches you how to cook, not just how to make things.

For those of you wondering about if you should buy the book after watching the show, here's my suggestion.
If you liked the show, buy the book. Regardless of what you liked about the show, you will find more of it in the book and will enjoy it.
If you didn't like the show because it didn't teach you much, buy the book anyway because the book teaches what you were expecting the show to.

It was so much worse-- it tasted off and no improvement in crispiness.  I saw so many chefs (looking at you, Bon Appetit) doing it and swearing by it that I was convinced I might have messed it up the first time and should try again.  Nope, same result!
This is a classic ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"".  A grilled cheese was always perfect-- there is no hack or improvement to this platonic ideal of crispy, buttery bread breaking through to the warm lava flow of melty cheese.  The butter is an essential element, giving the nuttiness of it browning in the skillet and perfect texture.  Go ahead and riff on it with all the combinations and additions all you like, making delicious melts of all varieties, but don't change the core elements: bread, cheese, and BUTTER.

I had recently read a thread on here about kitchen mistakes and people were saying the worst is when you forget to place a pan under the strainer, and accidentally poured their stock down the drain. So, obviously I was hyper vigilant about it. Strained my stock and set it in the pan to one side to cool. Next time I go into the kitchen the pot is empty. How thoughtful, he must have put it in the fridge. No, he poured it down the drain claiming he thought it was dirty dish water, like a pot left to soak.

So I moved last month, new apt in Brooklyn. Love the space, the neighborhood, decent rent. Three cats.
A small downside: the common hall/stairwell is suuuper narrow (3ft maybe).
My roommate and downstairs neighbor keep bikes locked to the handrail, taking up >50% of the width of the hallway. Spoke w my roommate and put polite sticky notes on the neighbor’s door, asking for a bike free hall.
My roommate obliged immediately!!
My neighbor however… has been texting me over the last 2 weeks essentially refusing to do a thing. Tons of pity-me energy and passive aggressiveness. - “Sorry this is a slight inconvenience for you, hmmm 🤔”
They won’t:
- store bike on the bottom floor where there is more room
- store bike outside with a lock (fear of theft)
- put the bike in their apartment (no space)
- buy a wall mount (no money)
- let me spot them $ for the mount (not comfortable)
I’m a large guy. Every day I scoot past this bike and if I have groceries/packages/coats then there’s no getting around it; we have to bang the bike up as we scoot on by.
I get it — bike storage is tricky. But it’s not on me to figure out. The bike is obtrusive and 100% violates fire code.
I emailed property management about it today, two weeks after the post it’s. Now the neighbor is calling me a Karen when all I want is to walk to my place without banging past her damn bike like 4x a day lol.
I’ve contacted property management — we’ll see if that goes anywhere.

badroommates,https://old.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1mhkgoo/new_roommate_wants_the_4_br_to_herself/,21004,1778,New roommate wants the 4 br to herself.,"Just moved into a new place. She would rather have it to herself
I (22F) just moved into a 4 br apartment in Brooklyn. I found this place on June homes and I am here for a little over 3 months.
Upon my arrival to this apartment, my roommate, S (27F), looked absolutely shocked to see me walk in. I politely tell her that I am one of her new roommates.
“Oh did they not tell you? They give me the option to approve or deny roommates and I sent them an email saying I didn’t want to live with you.”
Ok, strange first interaction with someone. I then told her that they had already taken my money and therefore I will be living here. All is ok and I don’t see her until the following day.
I was moving the rest of my stuff in and we were discussing our habits. She likes to have her own things and I told her that was absolutely fine. I had my own plates and cookware as I have a food allergy. I then go to throw something away and she tells me that I cannot use her kitchen garbage can. I explain to her that I would not mind taking the trash out if it meant that I didn’t have to go out and purchase another garbage can. She agrees.
Mind you, her belongings take up the majority of our shared living space (empty boxes, bins, and clothing). It is to the point where it is blocking the bedroom door of another tenant. S also has 2 cats— I believe they are registered ESA animals but I am unsure if both of them are. They have been in her room the entire time since I moved in (poor cats).
Fast forward to yesterday. I am getting ready to leave for a friends birthday party and I need to shower and use the bathroom. I check at 8:30 and the shower is on. I then go and do my thing for about an hour and the shower is still on at 9:30. I knock on the door and S opens it. She is not showering but has the tub faucet on for some reason. Eventually she leaves and I am able to do my thing. But S had been using the bathroom for well over an hour, which rubbed me the wrong way.
Fast forward to this morning. I was coming in from staying the night at my friends and I see my dishes on the counter. I assumed that she had ran the dishwasher while I was out and has left it out for me to put away.
This was not the case. She went out of her way to empty everything that was not hers from the dishwasher and just washed her own dishes. She comes out of her room. And my dirty dishes had just been sitting on the counter overnight.
“Did you take my things out of the dishwasher?”
“Oh yes sorry I can empty my stuff out now”
In this moment i then meet the person who is in the room next to me, N (~28M), and we discuss how she has been acting. Apparently when he had toured the place S was out there trying to convince him not to move in. The person giving the tour says that S does this frequently, and it seems as though she wants this 4 bedroom apartment to herself. Again, very weird and a bit antagonistic.
30 minutes go by and I see a note on the trash can.
“I know I told you I was comfortable with you using my trash can but now I am not. Can you please buy yourself a new one.”
This really set me off. She comes out and I ask her if she can move some of her belongings out of the shared space to make room for another trashcan.
“I don’t have any space in my room”
Not my problem I fear. I then explain to her that it is very weird to take someone’s dirty dishes out of the dishwasher without saying anything. And I questioned why she can only wash her things and not anyone else’s. I tell her that we can use the dishwasher pods I bought.
“I can’t use that dish detergent it would ruin my plates”
I just tell her that she needs to get rid of a few boxes so that there is space for others to have their belongings and we leave it at that. I purchase a new garbage can and bags and bring it inside. N is now in the shared space and says to S:
“Would you be able to move your trashcan? If none of us are allowed to use it I don’t think it should be in the shared space”
“I’m sorry I don’t have any space in my room”
N goes on to tell her that it doesn’t make sense to have that out in the common area when nobody else can go near it. He ate with that I completely agree.
And now I’m here trying to figure out what to do. I feel as though she acts this way to try to get people to move out.
I plan on documenting everything and keeping it handy should this get further escalated. But otherwise I’m unsure if there’s anything I can do. Any advice would be appreciated.","['https://preview.redd.it/zixwa4gdj1hf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=2f7402bf7eae37d8e20e231612d214fefda91239', 'https://preview.redd.it/7bzro4gdj1hf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=66d193ddd32b417aadb1951fed54b6f06745bdec', 'https://preview.redd.it/jwjkc4gdj1hf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=e94e6219340c9b1b5141055c9f3298dc1b9d13b9', 'https://preview.redd.it/9r7684gdj1hf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=9ed061fe5a1bcf6876df615f7f90ce1d66e53b58', 'https://preview.redd.it/zbxta4gdj1hf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=0423a38c890d9295de5077573b58e35983d631f7']"

Me (23m) have been living with 1 roommate (21F) because we had mutual friends, both needed housing, and it just worked out. We’ve been living together for 8 months now and everything was fine in the beginning.
She doesn’t go to school or have a job, she DoorDashes to be able to pay rent and utilities while I’m in school and working full time. I keep to myself, I don’t like drama, which is why I initially decided to move in with her because I thought she was very quiet and chill as well. When we first moved in we had no issues because I was working and in school all day while she would be DoorDashing majority of the day. Recently I noticed she has been staying home more, not out working as much, but again that’s none of my business… until you can’t pay rent and utilities.
To add more context, a few months in she started trying to flirt and come on to me and I never once fed into it — I’m simply just not attracted to her. And now she decided completely flip the script and make it look like I was the one that “came on to her”?
2 months ago she asked me to pay utilities because she couldn’t afford it but said she would pay me back as soon as she could. Then the next month came and she still couldn’t pay it back, so what did she do? Decided to come crying at my door about her finances and what a bad place she’s in and then proceeds to try and “offer herself” in exchange for me paying her half 2 months in a row. I was very put off and immediately shut it down because I didn’t want to make things awkward between us so I just pretended like it never happened.
Fast forward to today I receive a text asking for me to pay her utilities AGAIN, and when I decide to stand my ground she is now trying to “out me as gay” I don’t even know how to respond to this. I already contacted the landlord, but I don’t know what else to do, I’ve never been in a situation like this please help!

badroommates,https://old.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1ksmyae/almost_got_into_physical_altercation_over_noise/,14542,3358,Almost got into physical altercation over noise level,"Sorry, long rant incoming but I really need to get this off my chest.
I live in a really small apartment—basically a rooming house since there’s no living room and the walls are paper thin. We hear everything, especially through the vents. I’ve been here for 8 months and it was mostly fine before, mainly because my old roommate (technically my subletter) was also kind of the landlord and worked early shifts, so everyone kept it quiet after 11pm out of respect.
But ever since he moved out, things have gone downhill fast.
My current roommate is an alcoholic and stays up every single night until 3am drinking, slamming doors, cooking, watching movies at full blast, gaming, and having loud phone convos. I used to stay up late until 1-2am so I let it slide, but things changed recently after some health news.
I got bloodwork done and my doctor warned me I’m at risk for metabolic syndrome. Type 2 diabetes runs in my family and I am 30 pounds overweight. He told me I need to watch my diet and start working out to avoid the health issues in the future. I’ve committed to waking up at 6am for fitness classes and completely changing my lifestyle—better diet and consistent workouts. I even told both of my roommates this. Gave them a heads up that I’ll be waking up early every day.
But this girl has been LOUD every single night. Midnight, 1am, 2am—doesn’t matter. I’ve been surviving on 4–5 hours of sleep and I’m honestly hitting a breaking point. I’ve texted her politely, reminded her in person, even threatened to blast music in the mornings. I’ve had to go into her room at night and ask her to shut up. Nothing works.
Tonight I finally thought I’d get some sleep—she wasn’t home, and I passed out early around 11pm. Then 1:30am hits and I wake up to her coming home with FOUR people, drinking, laughing, playing music. Her room is right beside mine. I banged on her wall, got no response, so I texted her. She half-heartedly told her friends to quiet down but the music kept going.
Then I overhear her talking sh*t about me insinuating I’m “playing the victim” and that my cat wakes her up in the morning??? My cat maybe meowed five times total in 8 months—and never before 9 am and that’s being generous.
So yeah, I lost it. I stormed into her room and yelled. Told her she was being completely disrespectful and that this is now three nights in a row. And she has the nerve to mock me for my weight loss immediately and says, “Have fun with your weight loss” in a sarcastic tone. Her friends had to hold her back because she got in my face. I literally had to threaten to call the cops.
I’m seriously starting to believe she’s doing this on purpose. Like… how else do you explain it? I’ve told her I wake up at 6am every day now. Why the hell would you invite a group over to drink and party directly beside someone’s room at 1:30am?
Please tell me I’m not losing it. I feel like I’m going crazy.","['https://preview.redd.it/a4axrnbk4b2f1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=f121f0629903c6743b6002adc27126a39f16ff42', 'https://preview.redd.it/4die5wbk4b2f1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=8654e636256dc00a2f94d49e195d4acd5af0c8aa', 'https://preview.redd.it/6ugnrmbk4b2f1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=9bf1f69ce5cf6ad95c0774a311a2f80531f465d8', 'https://preview.redd.it/8vibbvbk4b2f1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=bdf1ef31115a3114f060d666e2ee5a6c11b01722']"

My main issue is that between the two of them they probably own 50+ pairs of shoes. Our very narrow hallway is becoming an extension of their bedroom and every pair of shoes you see belongs to the two of them. The black dresser is full of shoes. The wall cubby too.
I want to tell them to find space in their room or get rid of shoes. My bedroom door opens right up to their black dresser and their shoes are on both sides of my door now.

Upon calling her job the only response I got was “I’m sorry I think you have the wrong establishment we’re not having a payroll issue” I called a mutual friend who knows us both very well turns out roommate wasn’t at work last week…
I’m upset that she would even continue to lie but at least I got to the bottom of it. Tomorrow I’m going to go down to our leasing office to talk options. I most likely will never have a roommate again. Super sad. But eventually this will be something I look back on and just say “another thing that has shaped me into who I become”

i have just finished my second year at university and have been living in the same house in student accommodation the whole time. the student accommodation isn’t dorms, but a gated community of town houses that is a 5 minute walk from campus. each house has 5 rooms, 1 downstairs that is a ‘premium’ room as it is bigger (the room that i live in), and 4 upstairs rooms. each room has their own bathroom, but the kitchen, dining area and living area are all shared by the housemates. additionally, we all only pay rent for our own rooms so as people come and go from the university, we don’t have to deal with replacing roommates, etc., and management of the “village” is responsible for putting in new housemates and dealing with individual contracts.
here’s where it all goes wrong. at this point i’ve lived in my room in my house for 1.5 years and never had any issues with housemates (ive had upwards of 8 from all sorts of backgrounds and things were fine). the place is pretty chill, and everyone who lives there HAS to be a student at the university and is usually around 18-25 years old. semester 2 of university starts (around june as i live in australia) and there are 3 vacant rooms upstairs so im expecting some new housemates. as i come home one day, i see two middle aged ladies sitting at the dining table, so as i walk in the door i introduce myself and say that i live here and  ask who they are, and to my shock they say they are my new housemates. they explain that they are masters students who are both 40 years old and have just moved to australia from Korea together (one of them has a husband and 2 kids that she has left back home!!).
at first things are ok, but at around the second week of us living together things get strange. they message the house group chat complaining about a mess in the dining room that needed cleaning (which was just my jacket left on one of the chairs as i had forgotten to put it in my bag on my way to class). they said that they couldn’t eat lunch at the table because it was there, which i thought was strange (why couldn’t they just move it?) but i said sorry anyways and put it back in my room. things like this continue to happen until it starts to really frustrate me and my friend (who lives in one of the upstairs rooms).
the ladies then come up with their own rules for the house without consulting the rest of the housemates (who are all ages 19-21), and post them on the group chat. these include a DAILY vacuuming schedule, disinfecting the microwave after every use, forbidding the use or opening of the sliding doors to the house, keeping the curtains shut at all times during the day, we cannot make any noise (even playing music on our phones on half volume in our own rooms) and insisting that when they are using the kitchen or common areas, we cannot be in the kitchen or common areas either. me and my friend who lives upstairs decided to talk to them about these ‘rules’ because we both have lived in the house for 1.5 years and these ladies have lived here for 2 weeks, and we think that they are a bit unfair, ESPECIALLY as it is a very social place as it is university accommodation that is kind of made to accommodate younger students looking to make friends and enjoy the university culture/environment.
we talked to them super nicely and said that we want to make sure that they are comfortable in this house, and that we are willing to make adjustments if they are too so that everybody can be happy. instead of being polite, they essentially told us that they think because they are masters students and older than us, that they get to make the rules and we have to listen. i pointed out nicely pointed out after this that at the end of the day, we pay the same rent (i pay more as i have the downstairs room, but i didn’t say that) and that in this house we are equals and should all treat each other with respect despite any age differences.
After this, things got pretty tense pretty quickly and they became nasty. They would yell at us whenever we came downstairs, complain about tiny things, and ultimately write emails to management about us saying untrue things, and making it out to sound like we are hoarders and slobs who are forcing them to live in squalor. none of this i would like to point out is true, our house is usually pretty clean but of course there is just a bit of general mess that is created by existing as a human beings in the house, that we clean up at the end of the day after university if we haven’t already cleaned immediately after we made any mess (dishes, a few crumbs on the carpet, etc.). Also, our house gets monthly inspections to check for cleanliness and we have never failed.
naturally, admin takes their complaints pretty seriously and now we have been told off (even though the two ladies have attached no photographical evidence of the “mess”) and our house now has WEEKLY inspections.  additionally, we are now only allowed guests once at a time, for one hour at a time with their permission, even if we are just in our own rooms not making noise. admin doesn’t take us seriously when we try to tell them about the situation because we are half their age, and obviously they are going to believe the 40 year olds rather than the 20 year olds.
Anyways, I asked admin to make them attach photos of the “mess” they were complaining about every few days and to my surprise i received a call from admin shorty afterwards. in the phone call they said, we have received another complain from your housemates but after looking at the photos, we completely agree that “they are making mountains out of mole hills” and that they too are “sick of dealing with their complaints.”
another side note, i have a pretty severe anxiety disorder and having to deal with this whole situation for the last 6 months has been awful for my mental health. i haven’t been able to leave my room when they are out in the common spaces and even have panic attacks when using the kitchen for fear of them coming back and yelling at me. because of this i’ve been planning on moving out of the house, but family/financial situations haven’t allowed that. it’s holidays right now so im staying with my parents, but when semester starts up again in february i truly don’t know what im going to do to deal with them, the disrespect and endless complaints…
ALSO my friend from upstairs has now moved out because of them and the lack of support from admin, so im on my own. hopefully the new housemate who fills that room will be nice.
another note, in my opinion they are WAY too old to be living in student housing, and i just want to know what they expected when moving in with three 20yos?! and its not like there isn’t other cheap accommodation around. they moved together from korea, so why don’t they just move into their own apartment together if they have such a specific way for how they want to live?!?! also its not like they don’t know about the other housing options, because one day they showed me cheap apartments in the area that they suggested i move into because they didn’t want to live with me anymore….

I'll take advice though!
My roommate is 27 and her boyfriend is 30ish. She met her boyfriend shortly after we moved in and slowly but surely he was here every night and no longer had an apartment. Found this all out in over heard phone calls etc.
Didn't care much at first because he would help take care of her dog that was pissing all over the house but after a year I asked for him to pitch in. I was told he doesn't have any money and that she would talk to him.
A couple months later we get a lease renewal and she lets me know they are getting an apartment together. Which... if you can afford to move into an apartment together you can pay your fair share here. I asked for him to contribute for the last 3 months of our lease and then found out he has been paying rent. Just only to her.
For reference - we live in a luxury high rise in downtown Chicago with full amenities. This idea that he only uses her space is fucking nuts. They are fucking and fighting ALL over the house. For a while he was stealing my weed daily and even had the nerve to wake me up at 3am to give him weed. they use the common areas more than I do.
How are people this unaware?!?
Two nights after we exchange these texts my roommates boyfriend and friend come into the apartment while my roommate isn’t home and goes straight to my room, sees I’m there, then says ‘oh shit’ and closes the door. So for reference it’s 2 am and I wake up to two grown men in my room. They proceed to play music loudly and yell at me to ‘call the cops if I care. I have a sliding bedroom door that doesn’t lock or cancel out any living room noise.

It was very helpful. To those who were looking for more of a
r/maliciouscompliance
response from me, I believe you will be disappointed. I just don’t think that would be the smartest way for me to handle things, and would quite frankly be a little immature this early on into my stay here.
Secondly, I would like to explain a few things:
     1. S has been living in this apartment for well over a year.
     2. Our rental company works like student housing. All four of us have separate leases’ and we each pay for our own room and use of the shared space. You can rent a room for as little as one month, but up to 2 years.
     3. When a tenant is already living in the apartment they get an email showing them the profile of a potential new tenant. You can sign a form that is a “Notice of Decline” if you do not want to live with the replacement tenant. S tried to sign that for all 3 of us who have moved in. And I assume has done it to most people who have tried to live in the apartment with her.
I am pretty convinced S has some form of contamination OCD— which explains (but does not excuse) a lot of her weird behavior when it comes to separate trash cans, long showers, and not wanting to have other peoples dishes in the dishwasher with her things. Obviously, this is not really something I can bring up with her directly as that would be completely inappropriate, but it seems likely this is the case.
Last night, S moved the boxes that were blocking the doorway of the other tenant (before and after pictured above). I have now met that tenant, P, and he is not as concerned with this situation as he will only be living with us for a month. I am glad that she moved the boxes, however, they are now on another table in the shared living space. While it is now no longer a hazard related to the egress of P’s doorway, it still violates the lease terms because our shared space is still being used as her personal storage unit.
This morning, we had a cleaning lady come in who the rental company hires when new tenants move in. That was all fine until I heard S laughing with the cleaning lady and I stepped outside into the common area to see what was going on. As soon as I walk out, S asks the cleaning lady if they can talk about something outside lol. I would only assume she was complaining about us.
As for the report I made to our rental company, I have yet to hear back. Supposedly they will be calling S today and telling her to remove her belongings from the living room and if nothing changes in a few days, they will further escalate it.
N has now also made a report that also documents the antagonistic behavior S displayed when he was taking a tour of the apartment alongside the issue of her belongings. He has not heard anything back yet.
Overall, while I can empathize with the potential of her struggling with contamination OCD, her behavior towards us has been extremely rude and uncalled for. I’m hoping that pressure from the rental company can force her into getting a storage unit or throwing away some of the empty boxes in the living room. I don’t know if there’s really much else the rental company can do in regards to her behavior towards new tenants, but we’ll see.
Again, if anything else happens in the next day I will keep you all posted!","['https://preview.redd.it/hfkycuvi98hf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=6a5cce2717e3facd04e125cc8b7483d665de780c', 'https://preview.redd.it/1kyquuvi98hf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=d9704192e1804f9cd8de6c1520dbc8a1901a95da', 'https://preview.redd.it/utv47wvi98hf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=887e407961da86003cc66dc80ff2a98468ca3e28']"

First, thank you all for the support—it really meant a lot. I’m happy to say I finally moved out (thank God!) and I’m in a much better place now with a sweet roommate my age. I feel so much safer and truly blessed.
Unfortunately, things did not improve after my last post. He randomly called me the ER word (I’m Black), banged on my door aggressively, and cursed me out just because I told him to stop going into my private bathroom. He ate my food, would shut off the breaker to my room whenever I adjusted the AC (making it unbearably hot), and did little things just to get under my skin. I kept telling myself to stay calm and just hold out until I could leave.
When I told him my move-out date, I couldn’t finish everything in one trip since I was moving alone. I left two bags of clothes outside my door to grab later. He then emailed me (we only communicated through email) saying he hired a “cleaner” and that the bags were trash, so he’d throw them out. I told him to leave them alone, came back, put my stuff in my room, locked it, and left again.
The next day, I returned to find a chair wedged against my door to block me. When I finally got inside, I saw he tried to break into my room using a knife and multiple tools which is in the picture.  They were all stuck so deep he couldn’t pull it out, even with pliers. He tried to laugh it off and make jokes, but I just stared blankly, not giving him a reaction. Internally I was in disbelief, but I refused to show it.
I reported everything to the property manager, but she didn’t care at all. Throughout this whole ordeal, she never helped me—if anything, she fueled the situation. They’re clearly close. After I privately messaged her saying I planned to leave a negative review, he texted me 30 minutes later telling me to “think twice” before posting it.
When I called the manager, I asked why she shared a private conversation with him—especially knowing the danger I was in. Even when I sent her a photo of the door damage, her response was, “I’ll call him and tell him to let you move out.” Like… seriously? No sense of safety awareness. She still hasn’t given me any higher contact info despite me following up multiple times.
After a furious call, I haven’t heard from him since, which probably means she told him to back off. But yeah—this was a nightmare. I didn’t enjoy this “ride,” but I definitely learned from it and I will be building up my review (also does anyone have suggestions on sites I can report this building on, I want to do everything in my power to make sure this is seen by upper management everything I’ve had to deal with the PM who damn near encouraged everything instead of doing her job)
Again, I’m safe now. Everyone was truly surprised I made it out alive and me too honestly, i was always on my toes and made sure to always be aware in that apartment, honestly think it slightly traumatized me in a way but I don’t want this situation to affect me mentally. Other than that, my new roommate is kind and respectful, and it feels like a huge weight has been lifted. Thank you again to everyone who checked on me. ❤️","['https://preview.redd.it/5zjow6z0ttdf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=8872a58cb2bbdcccc33f90700a729a63f27e99d6', 'https://preview.redd.it/hts8rhz0ttdf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=2a9a6baf52de4eff0096ca61c4d55e520ccaec2d']"

For the first year we lived together, I did all the cooking, cleaning, and household management. Every single bit of it. I finally got burned out and about 5 months ago, I completely stopped. I only clean up after myself.
As you can guess, the common areas have become a disaster.
They've started leaving passive-aggressive notes telling me to clean specific messes they made. In the past, I usually just did it to avoid conflict. But I'm done.
The latest note, left on the fridge next to a mess they made, just says: ""Please clean.""
The ""please"" is new. It feels like a manipulation tactic because their previous, ruder notes stopped working on me.
I did not clean it. I am leaving it there. I am preparing for the argument that is definitely coming.
How would you handle this? How do I finally get it through to them that I am not their housekeeper and we need a fair system?
Did all chores for a year for my roommate couple. Stopped 5 months ago. They now leave notes demanding I clean. The latest one said ""Please clean."" I'm refusing and ready for a fight.
Edit: Cleaning Kitchen Broom & mop
Whole house plus Garbage, fridge,
Key is on the fridge . please

Second Edit:
Hi everyone, OP here.
I just wanted to say a massive THANK YOU to every single person who commented, upvoted, and shared their stories and advice. I was feeling completely defeated and your support and tough love gave me the push I needed to finally speak up. I read every comment, and I'm so grateful for this community.
Here's what happened:
I took the collective advice and finally talked to my roommates. It was direct, but I stayed calm and used a lot of the scripts you all provided.
The immediate result: They actually listened. They cleaned up the mess from the note today, and we've agreed to sit down next week on our mutual day off to create a formal chore schedule and system.
This is a huge first step. I know it's just the beginning and the real test will be if they stick to it, but it's progress I didn't have before I posted here.
Your messages did more than just give me advice; they made me feel justified and far less alone in this. From the people who told me to stop being a doormat to those who shared their own identical stories it all helped more than you know.
I'll try to update again after we have our meeting and see if the new system holds. Thanks again, everyone. You guys are the best.
🚨Final Update:
We talked and reached an agreement! I'll handle cooking, they cover groceries, and we're splitting chores (dishes, garbage, common areas). Thanks so much to everyone for the advice and support ;it really helped me advocate for a fair solution. 🙌",

I work in service so I mainly get weekdays off and work weekends, so whenever I’ve tried to do simple things like heat up food in the micronwave (NOT cook), bring in groceries etc while she’s in meetings she complains that it’s too loud or noisy… Today I went to the gym and when I got back she was on a zoom interview (which I was UNAWARE OF before I got home). When I got in and heard her on the phone I quickly took out my bathroom trash, grabbed some cleaning supplies I needed for my bathroom and then just went to my room to shower and was just gonna chill in my room till she finished. Then she sends me this??

(Everyone in this story is in college btw)
Recently during my spring break my girlfriend started to act really weirdly toward me, and it seemed like she almost didn’t want to talk with me. Well after 3 years of being with her, I told her that I could tell something was off and we needed to talk about it. So eventually we met up and I confronted her about avoiding me and hiding things. That is where she admitted to having spent all of that time with my roommate. I considered him to be one of my best friends at this point, and I really didn’t want to believe what was being told to me. I asked her if she had developed a romantic interest for him, and she told me that she had. The worst part of it all though? He had admitted his feelings for her as well, and they were hanging out even after the point. I asked her if she would stop talking to him if we continued to date, and she said no. So now not only did I break up with my girlfriend of 3 years, I have to continue to live with this guy for the rest of this year. We also signed a lease together for next year, but I’m in the process of figuring out how to get out of that currently. I would rather cut those people out of my life than continue to hangout with them, but being in this situation showed me how much I truly got a bad roommate. It just has all felt like a dark humor rom com at this point.
Edit: I really do appreciate all of the support that I have received from people. I just happened to stumble across this subreddit and decided to share what my roommate had done to me, and I never expected for there to be this much attention to it. I will post an update once I figure things out. Thanks again!

badroommates,https://old.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1mnk3vz/roommate_wants_4br_to_herself_update_3/,6403,484,Roommate wants 4br to herself: UPDATE 3,"Unfortunately this update brings little good news— in fact, I am now so annoyed and at my wits end that I will be escalating and complaining until I get my way.
Let’s start with this weekend, shall we. I stopped by my storage unit to grab a few things. One of those things being my PC. Im starting a remote position and need it for work. There’s simply no room for me to bring my desk so I decide that I will be moving one of her boxes to make room for my monitor, keyboard, and mouse. And I did just that! Pictured above you can see my disgusting setup lol. I was able to get my work done yesterday night and all was well.
Later that night I am out in the common room and S approaches me.
“Would you be able to move your computer? I use those bins for cooking”
“I would but there is literally no room for me to fit a desk in here.”
“Do you want me to move my things?”
I simply do not understand how someone has this much and insists that they need and use all of it. I moved my things. She pushed her table all of 6 inches. Some of you might say that I should have kept it there and stood my ground. I get that and my plan is to just move the box when I need it and put it back when I’m done working. Because I found out something this morning that has truly set me off.
Today, N and I received another update from the rental company. You can read what they wrote us in the second image. How I chose to read it was:
“We know S has been breaking the lease and has been antagonistic towards you guys, but she’s moving out in 2 weeks so we actually solved the problem :)”
Actually no. No problem was resolved, in fact it was made worse. This enraged me more than anything S has ever done. June homes basically told us to go fuck ourselves and pay the full price of the rent. Lol not on my watch. Immediately upon receiving this message I call their support line and I am connected with a man who can essentially guarantee nothing.
I explained to him that I don’t understand how they are expecting me to just let this slide when she is literally breaking the lease by having her things in the room. I will not be paying full price when I cannot use a large part of the space I am paying for. I Karen-ed out on him. He said that I likely will not get any sort of refund whatsoever. I am going to absolutely make sure that is not the case.
After calling I looked to see if they had physical offices in manhattan, as I was in the area for a job interview. I walked to two address that were listed for them and it seemed that neither were correct.
Quite frankly, it is a slap in the face to just let this slide without any sort of compensation. She is literally breaking a contract. I wonder if I can escalate this legally, because I am unsure if they will listen to me. I included a couple of screenshots of the lease that I think would be helpful in my case. Let me know if there are things that I should be looking for in the lease that would give me a better case!
At this point it is beyond S and I am just now so annoyed with June Homes. The man on the phone said they would resolve this later today but we will see.","['https://preview.redd.it/9hf336ieifif1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=a6ca5bf5dccdc04e1b397127d6161b9ef45091e0', 'https://preview.redd.it/lpc5d6ieifif1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=829a4e17b5c3a6b95642bc88ba6eb49b9cd4665a', 'https://preview.redd.it/mgbcs5ieifif1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=ca72c1a12b5c286bfeabb8de6ddce10cd30f1950', 'https://preview.redd.it/al3kd6ieifif1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=39333d421479133963292fb8c75d6ead9db68b77']"

badroommates,https://old.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1mwab0y/my_roommate_is_insane/,6002,741,my roommate is insane?,"omg where to begin. this whole thing has been a nightmare for me and my other roommate and it’s not even done yet. i (f20) needed to move out of my family’s place and was connected to these two girls through a common housing worker. i met A (f24), my awesome roommate and we viewed a place together which is the place we’re at now. i didn’t actually meet B (f18), until we moved in but i talked to her on the phone once. very stupid i know. what’s extra stupid is that she told me she has a criminal record for assault but i believed her when she said she changed and is working on herself. problems kept becoming apparent the longer i lived with B….
she has someone over every. single. day. just all these people coming and going all the time. she’s 18, so all her friends are literal children and they all come over to get drunk and eat our food and watch tv outside of my room. does she clean up after any of these people? of course not. recently she had like 6 different people over with 24 hrs and one of them stole a bag from a girl at the gym. she left, and the owner of the bag tracked her airpods to our house. the upstairs neighbours got involved too and were very upset. B and her friends all swore up and down they didn’t have her bag but the airpod tracker showed that they were obviously here. the police were called and her and her friends left and i had to deal with the policewoman and let her search the house and answer all these questions. it was terrible and really embarrassing. we know the airpods are still in the house to this day because the girl could connect her phone to them in the house but the police gave up looking.
she has vacuumed and mopped only once since living here. and she didn’t even mop properly, i had to redo it because the floor looked worse than how it was before. not once cleaned the fridge, counters, stovetop, microwave, or bathroom. and she makes these areas very messy. i try to wait until she does it herself but ive learned it’ll never happen and i eventually can’t stand it anymore and clean it myself. she also doesn’t do her dishes, her bf does them (and doesn’t clean them properly). and when i ask her to do them she’ll only do a few and then leave the rest. and they’re not even clean there’s still food on them… or she just keeps dishes in her room until there’s mold growing on them.
her bf basically lived here for 2 and a half months. i could seriously count the amount of times he WASNT here on one hand. he didn’t pay rent, ate our food but didn’t contribute to groceries, showered here every other day. turns out he had been assaulting my roommate in her sleep this whole time and she broke up with him. they would have really loud messy fights and would choke her in front of me all the time. it was like a sex thing for them and even she said not to do it in front of me when i expressed it made me uncomfortable and he kept doing it. his friends also maced her with bear spray for talking bad about him. i found out they got back together when i saw her sneak him out of her window and walk around the house. i had also seen someone get out of the shower with her the previous night but assumed it was this other guy she was seeing. so that means her abusive and violent ex stayed the night without any of us knowing, even after we and our other roommate clearly expressed that we never wanted him at the house ever again.
today was my fucking breaking point. my other roommate heard them having sex and when we asked if he was here she said he was staying over because she felt bad that he was having problems at his house. i am like actually livid. now she absolutely hates me for daring to be upset at her behaviour. me and my other roommate are writing an email to our property manager tomorrow to try to get her out soon. she has said previously that she’ll move out because she knows she’s not a good roommate but i’m like a year… which is our whole lease?
this whole thing has been using up so much of my mental energy these last months i can’t wait until she’s gone. i can’t even relax in my own house. theres been so much more stuff but i’ve already wrote so much. sorry for any typos.","['https://preview.redd.it/o8wpc5b7fdkf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=6db0bf8a5642ccbfcc7f8d6db8728fe3c2bfb838', 'https://preview.redd.it/x241z4b7fdkf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=06f488b9d8594862ff30a843a472bc45dc959a78', 'https://preview.redd.it/6069n6b7fdkf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=716c24e96adf304a0014275133e6be268e45fa6c', 'https://preview.redd.it/7cyjf4b7fdkf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=7fe042e85ce83c6bffb77011d5ab6f1eef82cd8c', 'https://preview.redd.it/y2zg2cb7fdkf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=48a25cf9a817966e13a51ef1c82e79324c9a55f6', 'https://preview.redd.it/nmoz85b7fdkf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=fa30f82b2a2ee342471140fd4cb4d16a1d82e391']"
badroommates,https://old.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1eav7jz/my_roommate_thinks_its_funny_to_trigger_my/,5921,935,My roommate thinks it's funny to trigger my tourettes to say the N word,"Edit 2: Since people keep coming back to this post I thought I'd let y'all know; 11 months later and I'm very happily living by myself with 0 roommates!
My roommate (30s m) and I (26f) are both white, I have coprelalia which is the rude version of tourettes. My roommate thinks the N word is just the most hilarious thing ever, he thinks it's even funnier to trigger my disability in a way that forces me to say a racial slur that I don't want to say. I have repeatedly told him that 1, I don't want to say the N word regardless of if it's voluntary or not and 2, the more I tic the N word the more often it will happen randomly and the more difficult it is to supress it in public. I cannot seem to explain to him that ticcing the N word in public can actually put me in serious danger, not everyone wants to hear ""I have tourettes"" after I tic something offensive, especially when it comes to racial slurs
Idk what to do at this point other than just avoid him and move out when the lease ends
Edit: holy shit this blew up. I'm going to try and clear up some misconceptions I'm seeing in the comments.
I've seen a lot of people accusing me of being racist for having an N word tic. Coprolalia takes what I subconciously perceive as socially inappropriate and forces me to say it. It doesn't make me say what I'm thinking, it doesn't make me say what I want to say, it usually makes me say things I really really do not want to say. I've never voluntarily said the N word, I also never said ""Bob Doll"" before it became one of my most common tics and yet it happens frequently. There is a tremendous amount of documentation on coprolalia, if you don't believe me I encourage you to educate yourselves on the condition before berating me for something you don't understand
Some people are asking how it's possible for someone else to trigger a tic. Tics can be triggered by any number of things. Stress is probably the biggest one, if I'm anxious about ticcing something specific it makes it far more likely to tic that specific thing. Quoting tics is nearly a guarantee to get me to tic whatever you're quoting, if someone says ""Bob Doll"" or even just ""Bob"" I'm going to tic ""Bob Doll"". My roommate is saying the N word to trigger that specific tic. I have a few other random triggers, extended eye contact makes me tic ""c*nt"", fist bumps cause ""fuck you"" and just seeing a very tall woman I know causes me to tic ""big woman, biiig""
A few people have dug into my profile, they saw that I've made posts about being autistic and having dyslexia. According to these people I must be fake because apparently you can't be autistic, have dyslexia and tourettes all at once. Tourettes, autism, dyslexia and ADHD (I also have that) all have very high comorbitiy rates. It's extremely common for people with autism to have ADHD and nearly every single person I've ever met with ADHD has dyslexia. Tourettes is less common but still has a high comorbitiy rate with both ADHD and autism.

There's a lot of people who think this is funny. I find that absolutely fucking appaling for a number of reasons. First off, anyone with a maturity level beyond a middle schooler can understand that a white person saying a racial slur is not funny. Additionally, you have no idea how humiliating it is for someone to play with your disability as a way to amuse themselves, it's fucking awful. I can't imagine the people who do think it's funny have enough empathy to even hear what I'm saying but Jesus Christ what the fuck. You're laughing at something that genuinely puts my life and career at risk
My roommate is a POS, I'm not able to move yet but hopefully in 4 months I will be leaving with my partner and one of the roommates I actually like. I don't want to escalate anything, I only see him a few times a week and some of the suggestions people have made (ear defenders, ignoring him) should do the trick just fine until I can move and never speak to him again
The negative comments have really been getting to me, I probably just shouldn't be interacting with them but it really sucks seeing people with absolutely no understanding of tourettes judge me for my disability. For the most part comments have been really kind and supportive, I really appreciate all the nice people here. My situation is pretty awful but I'll be ok till I'm able to move. Thanks to everyone who's been nice and especially thank you to those who are clearing up misconceptions about tourettes for me. Y'all are awesome",

This is a follow-up to my original post about my roommate (Roommate 1 / “Bad Roommate”) who neglected her cat, disrespected shared spaces, and clashed with me any time I tried to set a boundary or compromise.
About 5 days after I texted her asking if we could grab coffee and talk things out (no response), it’s her birthday. I expected some noise, sure—it’s her house too. She had people over the night before, so I figured that was it.
NOPE.
Monday night, I’m asleep by 11 because I have in-office work on Tuesdays. At 2:30 AM, I wake up to a huge group of people coming in. Music starts blasting. It’s a full-blown afterparty in our living room—on a Monday.
The house is over 100 years old and the walls are paper thin. I text Good Roommate (Roommate 2), but she doesn’t reply because she left her phone upstairs to check things out. Bad Roommate even directs drunk strangers to use Good Roommate and I's shared bathroom (which backs against my bedroom wall), so now I’m hearing people slamming the door, laughing, and stumbling all night. (Would like to mention Bad Roommate has her own private bathroom upstairs on our 3rd floor that is perfectly usable)
By 5:30 AM, I’ve gotten
zero
sleep. I peek out my window and—of course—some random dude is puking in our courtyard. Suddenly, I hear loud bangs, thuds, and yelling from the kitchen. I text Good Roommate again and find out a
f
ight broke out between random bar guys and Bad Roommate’s boyfriend’s friends. Just straight-up bar fight in my kitchen. I tell Good Roommate someone threw up outside. Good Roommate (bless her) casually asks Bad Roommate if anyone puked. Bad Roommate, instead of helping, asks the drunk guys
if they puked
(lol). They say no (duh), so she accuses
me
of being
paranoid and eavesdropping
.
Bad Roommate then goes to bed, leaving Good Roommate to kick out these drunk strangers until 7:30 AM.
Later that day — after crashing at work and faking a reason to go home early — I finally get a response to my message from
5 days prior
where I had asked to talk and ""apologize"".
Here’s what she sent me:
“You can and should apologize though and without therapy terms if possible, I’m listening. Also, I’m having people over Friday and would appreciate if you could get lost then ❤️”
See attached screenshot [pic below].
That was it. I’m done. Three days later, I signed a lease for my own one-bedroom. I move in Saturday. I have no idea why she insisted both Good Roommate & I not sign the lease for this current space, but I am so thankful for her stupidity. She doesn’t know yet, Good Roommate told me privately that she's skipping out early in June.
I’m out. I’m free. Reap what you sow. And no longer living with someone who thinks “get lost” is a cute way to communicate.

i got an ebike a little after moving in, so i could get to and from work without sinking money into uber. because i couldnt afford a car. i came home one day and she had, of her own accord, cleared a spot in the living room for me to put it, since before i was just trying to park it as out of the way as i can. i thanked her and apologized that its pretty intrusive, saying i would keep it outside but im scared of it being stolen especially since our neighborhood is student housing. along with the fact that the weather here is pretty brutal and i dont think it would survive being snowed and rained on. she said no worries and that the spot she cleared is out of the way enough it isnt a bother.
however, after about 6 months, she, with no communication or warning to me, completely freaked out about the dishes and how i was ""poisoning"" all of her kitchenware. she ended up locking literally everything up in big boxes that she then kept in the living room. again, whatever, weird, i wish she had just told me not to use the communal stuff, but i understand she has an allergy. i just shrugged it off and got my own dishes.
she has not stopped escalating this behavior since. she claims that im ""purposefully poisoning and trying to trick"" her, and that i apparently leave the kitchen a complete mess with crumbs everywhere every day. i like to think im a pretty clean person..? maybe not perfect, but i eat mostly microwave meals and wipe the counters down after using them and stuff. especially since i know she has allergies.
in the past month or so she decided to start focusing on the air conditioning, because i asked to have it a little lower since its been in the 90s, and my room gets blasted by the sun half the day (i got blackout curtains and they barely help) so its like 5-10 degrees hotter than the downstairs. she responded by saying she doesnt care and doesnt want the ac ""lower than what it is outside"" (??). i tried to tell her its so hot my cat is showing signs of heat exhaustion and to please have it be a little lower so my room has a chance to cool down. she again didnt care at all, saying ""i pay for half the electrical, so i dont want it on"". as if
i
dont ALSO pay for half of it. she was actually tearing the thermostat off of the wall for a while and hiding it in her room. i would just get an ac unit for my room but im gonna be honest im so poor i can barely afford groceries
shes also been freaking out if i ever leave an empty soda box by the garbage can. its completely out of the way of foot traffic. i dont let them stack up (maybe 2 total boxes at a time) and take them out when i take the trash out. shes been moving them and putting them in the sink, and outside my bedroom door?
lately she has been writing things like ""GET OUT"" and ""youre not welcome here"" on the side of the fridge and the cabinets. as well as turning the HEAT on when its still regularly in the 80s-90s outside. shes also been putting soap and wax on the kitchen chairs? i can only assume in hopes i sit down and ruin a pair of pants?? shes also thrown my waffle maker on the counter and broke it, and put wax on my shoes. so shes damaging my belongings.
shes also suddenly decided, like two weeks ago out of the blue, that she hates my bike and that ""vehicles belong outside"", and has been randomly moving it around downstairs and frequently ripping the charger for it out of the wall while doing so. i tried to explain to her again that i would put it outside if i could, and if its in the way to let me know, but to please not break the charger. she didnt care.
any time i try to communicate with her literally at all she starts screaming. like top of her lungs yelling. ive actually reported a bunch of this to my leasing office, since its gotten to the point shes breaking my things and yelling at me and i feel properly unsafe, rather than her just being kind of passive aggressive. the office did absolutely nothing when they came over. when they came in they said they ""skimmed"" my email, and seemingly instantly went to her. the only thing they heard me out about was, when she claimed i was ""putting
garbage
on the floor next to the bin"", i explained that it was empty cardboard boxes. and they said that is normal to do and its unnecessary to make a long trip to the dumpster every single time.
yesterday, she moved an empty box again, and i, admittedly extremely frustrated, but trying to be civil, told her to please stop moving them. she instantly exploded at me and yelled ""well its not that hard to take it to the dumpster"". i tried to remind her that the office themselves said that was unnecessary. and she responded by saying the office guy is a ""lazy slob"" too. my boyfriend was visiting and sitting at the counter at the time, and tried to tell her that her dog was cowering and shivering under his chair because shes screaming. she just responded by saying ""awww are you scared too?"". she tried to drag her boyfriend into it as well, who had stepped outside and come back in visibly nervous and confused as to why she was yelling. he just awkwardly said he was going to go and then left.
i attached some pictures of her responses on the whiteboard (im the smaller handwriting, if thats not clear), as well as the things shes writing on the cabinets..?? and my wafflemaker she cracked and broke. and my shoes. pictures might be a little out of order, im not sure

My roommate finally moved out tonight after a sixty day notice because I’m about to have a baby. He’s been notorious for being extremely messy and never showering. He wears the same clothes for WEEKS and my boyfriend and I recently discovered that he is now unemployed. I could go on and on about all the terrible awful things this man has put me through since I allowed him to move into my apartment, but it’s just way too much. I will add that he tried to let his homeless friend live with us under our noses and when I finally said I’d call the cops if I saw said friend, he resorted to allowing his friend live out of his car. So I’d sometimes see his homeless friend wandering the complex. It went from me feeling bad for the dude to just sheer hatred. He took advantage of our kindness and now I’m sitting here, 8 months pregnant wondering wtf I’m supposed to do. Fun little fyi..,his room was going to become my future daughter’s room. He hoarded his poor cat in there for over a year and could barely afford to feed the poor thing so he resorted to stealing my cats food sometimes. My boyfriend and I wondered how the fuck he was cleaning the litter box…well now we know.
Sorry if this is all over the place, I’m still shaking from this entire experience and have been in tears the past hour.
First picture is of outside his window months back btw
The rest is how he left his room tonight after moving out.

I live in off-campus student housing but a family is living under me who aren’t students at our uni. This specific rental company only allows students to live in all their complexes, but they do make exceptions when there are enough units open, especially for people who qualify for low-income housing.
I know Just by reading the note you are confused as to what is wrong why are your neighbors being crazy?  I arrived the the complex to move in at 6 pm since my home town is far from my uni, I CAME IN WITH ABSOLUTELY NO FURNITURE the only thing I arrived with was a mattress, 3 containers filled with necessities, my dog ( a 3 pound Chi), & a dream
I arrived at 6 unloaded left for the store at @7 got back at 7:45 put up groceries. Then I swept the floor to put up & fix my mattress. I will admit I did drop the broom, but that happened before 10 even if I was making noise it was normal living noises that can't be helped I was in my bed ready for bed doom-scrolling by that time I was asleep before 12 😩😩 I have an 8 am class like be so for real a person can't even move into their apartment without somebody complaining its the fact that they said we'll into after 12 LIKE BROOO I WAS ASLEEP I do have a roommate but she wasn't up either and already had been moved in she moved in 6months ago she's been telling me how they have left 2 random notes like that before but every time they do it never makes sense to them either they left one about the noise when no one was home for an entire weekend
I have an 8 am class and was up by 6 and they were not awake by 7 their kid was crying his lungs out and I could hear them yelling at him to shut up and go back to sleep 
I just moved in and I can already tell the downstairs neighbors are gonna be a nightmare 😩😩😩
This note pissed me off I know it's dumb I'm this mad but like I am very aware I live in a shitty apartment complex and noise is going to be expected I wouldn't expect people to tip-toe around me just so I'm comfortable that's why I have earplugs this is also student housing you kinda have to expect people constantly moving in and out not only day we are right across the uni so there will always be noise.",https://i.redd.it/jf4oc3tto1dc1.jpeg

He was in his late 40’s I was early 20’s and the other roommate (who found this dude) was in his early 30’s. This was a conversation we had when I was gone on vacation and had asked him to feed my cat (momma) for me. As you can see he texts like a psychopath. At first he was the ideal roommate because he did some kind of work overseas so he paid for two or three months and was never around. He sometimes would talk about how to get more money into other countries than you were allowed to bring.he would occasionally say other weird shit but I mostly ignored him. Shortly after I got back from this vacation I asked him to do his dishes because it smelled really gross in the kitchen. He grabbed his gun and threatened to shoot me and leave my body in the desert saying “I don’t give a FUCK. I’ve done it before I can do it again” fortunately I moved out shortly after. My cat was fine btw she had just slipped outside and since she only liked me, she ignored him calling for her. I had a friend go over and put food out for her, but before I had her she was an outdoor cat so she could take care of herself. ANYWAY. After I left it got weirder. They added another roommate who was a dude I said I absolutely wouldn’t live with. I guess at some point it ended with the new roommate pulling a knife on the psycho guy who pulled a gun and the third roommate was just stuck in the middle. The two got arrested but were released. Eventually the psycho dude ended up in jail for allegedly assaulting a child. this was when me and the other guy who had been living at the house together found out he had lied to us about his name and identity. He then allegedly killed himself in jail, but for a variety of reasons me and the other old roommate suspect he is actually still alive. Overall craziest shit I’ve ever had to deal with, I have lived with my partner now for years and I don’t miss having roommates at all.","['https://preview.redd.it/m71rquh97zhc1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=67aafddc01362910c2292119ea6817000de8f964', 'https://preview.redd.it/bfkuuth97zhc1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=aabcacf29ef4b73f0a3b7b2b6be613b770769e91', 'https://preview.redd.it/ktanyvh97zhc1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=e0c69d0d45bffd3d5d0f97836b5b6ea415a2b8ef', 'https://preview.redd.it/gb5thuh97zhc1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=acdda610b85e0977b45548774fa521216ee825e3']"

So does she but with a new roommate. landlord called me the other day about the snake, how she couldn’t get a hold of the roommate and she has no interest in leaving it outside bc the cats outside started to attack it, including her own. Landlord had no intentions on giving it back to my ex roommate. I called a friend to rescue the wittle baby. I’m surprised it survived this long.
Just a silly little story to share, but as how he escaped an apartment unit on the second floor & ended up on ground level? I don’t know lol. Any explanations how that can happen? Landlord thinks she purposely put him outside.",https://i.redd.it/ky50ta0ppw3e1.jpeg

She has eaten my food before, including something I got for my birthday, and apologized but did not replace the food…
Anyways, since her clothes were in the washer, I took it out and placed it in the bathtub while I ran my laundry. This is where I noticed my boxers were in her laundry… they’re fairly old/unique but I gave her the benefit of the doubt and checked my drawers and couldn’t find that pair. I also haven’t done laundry in awhile so I’m sure I didn’t previously leave them in the washer by mistake. Anywho, being the nice roommate that I am, I re-washed and dried her clothes after my load while she was at work but didn’t say anything to her after. However, I replaced my doorknob and will now keep my door locked when I’m not home. It sucks losing basic trust with someone you live with.",

Alright, so this week I (23F) was in the kitchen on facetime with my siblings. My roommate (24F) comes into the kitchen and immediately starts an argument with me. To preface, for the most part we buy groceries and other household stuff together. Recently I decided to buy a jug of canola oil and some seasoning for myself because I do a lot of home cooking and I wanted two things I could use separately, so I put it in my cabinet. She starts talking about how she went through my cabinet and how disrespectful I am for buying seasoning and oil for myself (even though I was the one who bought it for the house the past three times) and that she’s been using mine and is going to continue to use it. Obviously I’m taken aback by why she’s even going through my stuff and I say “I’m allowed to buy stuff that’s just for me. It’s not disrespectful but it IS disrespectful to go through my things without asking because I don’t do that to you. You’re not gonna keep using my personal belongings.” After I say that she says “Well, I guess neither of us are gonna use it.” and throws everything I have in my cabinet on the ground.
So immediately I’m upset over this and I tell her she needs to clean this up, to which she says “you can clean it up yourself” and I let her know how childish this was. She continues yelling at me then leaves the room so I tell her that I’m gonna tell someone that she did this because this isn’t okay, then she comes back to yell at me again and pushes me full force into the wall. At this point I’m running on emotions and tell her I’m gonna call the police if she puts hands on me again. I then leave the apartment and go to call her mom to de-escalate. Her mom tells me that I was in the wrong because I “should have communicated that I bought stuff for myself and put it in my cabinet” and starts to say “Oh, well I know she was having a really bad day which isn’t an excuse but it’s a reason.” While talking to her mom, my roommate calls me a “tattle tale” and a “liar” and says I’m always playing the victim.
After this I update my mom and call her and my siblings again when I get back in the house, then my roommate comes out of her room again to start arguing with me. She kept getting in my face, putting her hands on me and screaming in my face. She then tells me I’m “a terrible roommate, a scary ass hoe and a stupid bitch” then she says “I HATE YOU” Afterwards she continues to push me into the wall, tries to hit me with a fist and threatens to punch me in my throat. She then says that her reaction and response to what she did was valid and that I’m the only issue in this apartment. When I finally decide to stand up for myself she puts her mom on facetime and tells her I’m antagonizing her. I leave to another room and call both her mom and my mother to figure out what my next move should be but her mom just keeps saying I need to stay out of her way and that I’m instigating. I had to stay out of the house for 4+ hours until she left because both our parents were unsure if something would happen if I went back inside.
Honestly I never thought it would escalate to this over me buying my own stuff but idk what to do now. Clearly she has no issue assaulting me so idk if I feel safe here but I also don’t want her to go to jail.",https://i.redd.it/a81puvk67boc1.jpeg

We watch the same kind of shows and have similar interest so I thought I had made a mate and finally had a normal flatmate.
Recently, I decided to smoke some weed and watch the Vince-Staples show which is great imo. And he joins me and ask for a few puffs which is cool. Eventually he falls asleep and i just carry on watching until like 3 am when I decide to go to sleep.
As I get up he wakes up and just makes regular convo, after a minute or two I tell him I’m gonna head to bed and wish him a good night.
Tell me why as I’m on the toilet high as fuck at 3 AM this guy asks me if I want a blowjob? Even after declining he doubles down and says to just let him know if I ever reconsider. I should have mentioned but yea he’s obviously gay but also I have a girlfriend who comes round almost every week.
Wtf do I do now? It’s made me really uncomfortable and basically made me rethink this living situation. I used to cook meals for like 3 days because I workout a lot and let him have some now even that seems odd to me.
He’s also starting to send me Goodmorning messages like he’s my girl or something. Tbf this happened before but with a girl so I decided not to live with women anymore but this is just as bad if not worse.",
badroommates,https://old.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/18emrl1/landlordroommates_were_taking_advantage_of_me/,4611,514,Landlord/roommates were taking advantage of me,"This is from about a year and a half ago before I moved out and bought my current house, me and my girlfriend were living with my ex friend and his girlfriend, and the house was in her name.
I had moved in summer of 2019, cheap rent, but house was in pretty piss poor condition, but I wanted to move out just to be on my own. When covid hit, all 3 of us (me, friend and his gf) ended up on unemployment, I found a job at Amazon soon after but they wanted to stay on unemployment just to not work and make the extra money they got from it. In summer of 2020 they decided to buy a Rv (for like 6000, so it was not a good rv by any means), and travel the country while on unemployment. In October of 2020 my girlfriend moved in with me, and we signed a new month to month lease stating we'd be the only 2 in the house, take care of all utilities ourselves, etc.
In early summer/late spring of 2021, they moved back in because their rv broke down (of course, anyone with a brain could've guessed that would happen), but they never changed the lease and I am not confrontational and just went with it (mistake on my part). I knew they were still on unemployment and making very little money, so I decided to just continue paying all utilities myself, even though they both lived there, and I never said anything because I thought I was just being a good friend.
Flash forward to spring of 2022, I'm in the process of buying my house, getting everything settled, they have jobs now but still aren't paying anything for utilities or anything. I decide to message my friend one day and ask if he'd be willing to pay half of the utilities until we move out so I can free up some money to help repair my house i was buying and get stuff it needs. He instantly says something along the lines of ""it says in the lease the utilities are your responsibility"". Instantly I was fuming, but I just took some deep breaths, said okay, didn't message anything else about it, even though I know the lease was pretty much null as it stated it was only supposed to be me and my girlfriend in the house.
A couple weeks later, as we get the keys to our house and begin working on it as fast as we can so we can leave. I had no plans to pay anything that month, none of the utilities or rent. I didn't tell them this, I was done with them and just going to let them figure it out. Eventually his girlfriend tries to set up a meeting with me to talk, I knew exactly what she wanted to talk about as the due dates for the utilities was coming up and it hasn't been paid, so I kept blowing her off. When she sent me the second to last text about how the login hasn't changed, me and my girlfriend decided right then and there, in the middle of the night, to grab all our shit and move out even though we really wanted to wait a couple more days. Called up a few friends with trucks, loaded everything up, made a few trips, took to about 630-7 am and we were finally free and away from them in our new house.
The last text is what his girlfriend sent after they realized we moved out. The key she's talking about was the spare key I had made for my girlfriend, I paid for it so I wasn't giving it to them, broke it and threw it out.

badroommates,https://old.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1irl93c/my_housemate_is_convinced_my_glasses_are_hers/,4307,923,My housemate is convinced my glasses are hers,"(Need advice) First time posting on reddit so please bear with me.
My housemate (25f) and I (24f) have gotten into the dumbest argument and I genuinely don’t know how to navigate so please give me some advice. To preface this is the start of our third year living together and there’s always been issues with her being unreasonable and honestly just rude. I’ve kinda just ignored everything else or tried to deal with it as amicably as I can but this has sent me over the edge and I’m just sick of it.
I have had rosemary propagating in one of my glasses and I get a text message from her with a picture of my glass saying “don’t use these cups as vases” to which I’m like what why not? because in my head why can’t I do what I want with my own glasses?
Then she says that they’re her glasses and she doesn’t want them to be used for anything else but for drinking. At this point I’m so confused because I have never seen any glasses like these apart from mine in the house (they’re kind of tall tumbler cocktail glasses with diamond patterns around). So I reply saying, “they’re definitely mine ahaha what, I even have the matching shot glasses” because I literally do?
She replies “wym they’re definitely yours, like I just made it up, you met them here. Maybe you have shot glasses like them but these glasses are mine and please don’t use them as vases.”
I tried to explain that my friend bought me the glasses for my birthday a few years ago and they came in a set of two but one was broken when I opened the box so she bought me another pair and that’s why there’s only 3 there, and I saw matching shot glasses like literal matching from the same store and I bought them before I even moved into the place I’m at now. So unless we do have the same glasses then I apologise but I know 100% that I have the same so I assumed the one I was using was mine.
She replies with “look I’m not finding this sick joke funny. Whoever gave you yours to you is not my concern. The three glasses in the cupboard are 1000% mine and have been in this house since before you moved in ask (previous housemate) and (current housemate). They were gifted to me in 2020 by someone who supported me after my dad passed, along with a few other house items. They have a lot of sentimental value even though they leak, so while I normally wouldn't speak up about you using my other glasses as vases like you have in the past, I will not allow it for these ones. I also don't appreciate that you laughed about it but whatever. For the last time don't use my drinking glasses as vases, all of them in fact.
Go and look for where you kept yours and use them as vases.
The beer glasses were given to me by the same person. These are not even glass styles that I would normally buy for myself but they were given to me at a very crucial time in my life, so for you to tell me that ""they're definitely yours ahahaha"" like we're playing here or something. Don't let me crash out because of fucking glasses because I will.”
And while I am empathetic to her I feel like I’m losing my mind because I know these are mine and so I spent ages trying to find a picture of them from before I moved into the current place. And I do find a picture and video of the broken glass from the first set from December 2021 and it is the exact same glass I swear. I sent her the picture with the date and the video saying, “I am 100% sure those are mine, here’s a video of the fourth glass that was broken in 2021.”
She replied saying that it doesn’t automatically make the ones in this house yours, and that the glass of the broken glass is thick. 
Which by the way the glass is broken at the base where the indentations are so of course it would be thicker than the rim. And she emphasises her previous message that says “go and look for where you kept yours and use them as vases.”
I don’t know where to go from here I would’ve thought that proof of the glasses would be enough and especially the explanation of there being 3 glasses because glasses aren’t normally sold in odd numbers. I feel like I’m going crazy and I was even second guessing myself while I was searching for the photo. I don’t know if maybe I’m being unreasonable but I feel like I need to end this because it feels so unnecessary. Please help me.","['https://preview.redd.it/hl8fxohrnpje1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=9a2b4b5134ac8d605a85f3cf2c388448ae628d95', 'https://preview.redd.it/9klc4shrnpje1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=1fff777060cab409cfe11e7b6197e774891f13b5']"

His brother also has a dog that owes and poops everywhere that he will leave for days/weeks. My best friend hasn’t had a job since January and rent day is always stressful. When his brother moved in we have had to help pay rent ever since. We almost got our gas and water shut off because no one has money except me. I go to work just to come home and see them chilling on the couch and it makes me so angry.
A few weeks ago I saw the dog peed by the steps and asked his brother to clean it up to which he came downstairs and screamed at me for 5 minutes. After that I just want to leave. Today we got into another argument (texts) and now I feel like I’m being gaslit because the brother is acting so nice all of a sudden and now my best friend is basically telling me if I leave he’s gonna end it.

badroommates,https://old.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1ngadte/my_roommates_went_from_friendly_movie_nights_to/,4100,97,My roommates went from “friendly movie nights” to breaking into my locked room for makeup. I’m over it.,"When I first moved into my off-campus apartment with three other girls, things were fine. We weren’t best friends, but we were friendly watched movies, cooked together, had a decent vibe.
Then the boundary issues started. First it was little things: snacks disappearing, shampoo running out twice as fast, laundry detergent mysteriously gone. When I brought it up, they’d laugh, deny it, or promise to replace it (never happened).
Then it got bigger. I saw one roommate wearing my wristwatch on Snapchat without asking. Another time, I came home to strangers sleeping in my bed. They also loved to use my special cooking tools (that I bought myself) and leave them greasy or slightly damaged.
That’s when I finally locked everything down bought a lockbox, a mini fridge, and started locking my bedroom door. They called me “paranoid” and “dramatic,” but honestly, it was the only way to have peace of mind.
At first, it seemed to work. Things were tense, but they eventually apologized, and I thought maybe we’d turned a corner. Then, two days later, one roommate literally broke into my locked room to grab makeup because she “really needed it.” I wish I was exaggerating, but nope.
That was the final straw. My family’s coming to help me pack up, and I’m leaving. I don’t care if the lease overlap is a headache I’m not living with people who think breaking into my room is acceptable behavior.",

He also didn’t supply ANYTHING for the place — me and A furnished it, we own all the pots, pans, silverware, cups, plates, bowls, bath mats, sponges, TP, paper towels you name it.

He was under strong anesthesia for nearly 4 hours. They finally call and say we can come see him, but warned us he was EXTREMELY high from the anesthesia.
I (F19) have been with him for almost a year and a half. We tell each other we love each other multiple times a day every day. I have never doubted he loves me. But today was just a new level.
He comes out of the ICU, he doesn’t see me at first, and then the nurse points to me and says “there she is!” He looks at me, begins to cry and reaches his hands out for me like a baby, telling me I was the most beautiful thing he’s ever seen in the whole world, he is so happy to see me, he loves me, he can’t believe I’m his girlfriend, staring at my face, kissing my hands. The nurses told me he couldn’t stop talking about me when he woke up after the surgery. He grabbed my hand the whole way back to his room, and while we are in the room, every single time a nurse came in, he asked them “isn’t she so pretty? This is my girlfriend!! She is so sweet” and I honestly could not keep myself from crying. He was in so much pain, yet he would still grab onto my hand and smile at me from his hospital bed. He would drift off to sleep still holding my hand, then wake up and freak out until I reassured him I was right next to him, and he would just smile so big and adorable and fall back asleep again. I don’t even know if he will remember all of this tomorrow, but I don’t care. I don’t know how I could love this boy even more, but I do.

But I took a chance and started talking with him anyway-and then never stopped.
He lived in a town three hours away from me and after three months of spending every spare second we could talking online, he made the long drive to take me on our first date. It was love at first sight for the both of us. The kind of legitimate, heart-eyes love at first sight you only see in cheesy rom-com movies. For six months,every single weekend he would either drive down to spend the weekend with me or I would catch a Greyhound to go see him.

We have a baby on the way, and she is delighted to be a mom. As her pregnancy advances, I notice her becoming more emotionally reliant on me. We planned to move in together when my lease ends on the 30th. Although we still have separate apartments, I sleep at her place often.
I could not stay over last weekend as I had to take a trip out of state. The opportunity finally arrived for me to spend the night with her yesterday. I stopped by after work, and she gave me the tightest hug. We started making dinner as I talked about my trip. She got quiet suddenly and appeared to be distressed.
I squeezed her hand and asked if everything was alright. She looked at me with misty eyes and said she gets anxious when we aren't together. She told me I make her feel safe and she can only sleep when she is in my arms. Her words were so touching that my eyes began to water. I offered to move in this week and promised she would never spend another night without me.
She fell into my chest, and tears flowed while I held her. No one ever made me feel more cherished and loved. She wiped her cheeks and shared a long kiss with me after. I felt her lips curl into a smile, and my heart
exploded

I went to volunteer this morning and suffered from dehydration, low blood sugar, and heat exposure. I texted my husband that I was starting to feel nauseous. Quickly after I sent that text, I vomited and could no longer look at my phone without feeling faint. I didn't know I was dealing with those three things at once. So, at that time, all I could think about was pulling my hair to help relieve pressure on my scalp in a random parking lot. A kind worker came by and sat with me while I tried not to puke again. She asked me if she could call an ambulance for me. I refused and told her that I could call my husband. She pointed towards the crowd, where the race's finish line was. She said he could enter from that way and come pick me up. I turned my head to where she had pointed and saw my husband practically running towards me. Maybe I had dry eyes; maybe it was the culmination of a long morning. But seeing him come straight for me in a crowd of strangers made my eyes well up with tears. They spilled down my face, and I turned my head down to try and hide the fact that I was crying.
I'm home, in bed, and have been resting since he found me. He told me he'd always take care of me and he has never broken that promise.",

She is a SAHM to three kids. 7,5,3. And I work from home full time and provide for my family.
Through my office door, I can hear the kids definitely challenging her today. Just not listening, extra fussy. I left my office, and I can see all over my wife’s face that she is overwhelmed, stressed and tired.
Sooo. I called off work, gave her my credit card, we both have bank cards. And a joint account that we both use freely. But for today, I think some serious retail therapy is in order. And I will pay the balance off at the end of the month. So I am the one with the credit card. I gave her kiss a hug and kicked her out of the house.
I told her not to come back until she buys something for herself that she truly wants, eats a nice meal, drink a fancy drink, go get a message. Shoot, even book a hotel room for two days just to be by yourself and enjoy peace. Whatever you need to do for your self care, go do it! She gave me a kiss, a hug, didn’t fight me and left in her car.
Will she be back? I’m not sure 😅
Now im going to have a clam but firm conversation with our boys. On why they need to respect their mother. And challenge all of them on what we can do around the house to show her how much we love her. Before she gets back home.( if she comes back)
You see as a dad, I don’t struggle with kids like she does. Granted I work 9-5 so I am not with them all day. But when I do have days off, or let my wife sleep in while I cook the kids breakfast, or their lunch. I don’t get any back talk, attitudes. What I say goes and that’s it. If the kids are getting in each other’s nerves, I give them a warning and they stop. I don’t yell at them or spank them. If my wife and I are together with the kids. It’s calm and quiet. As soon as I leave let’s say to go to the bathroom, store whatever. All Hell breaks loose.
I grew up in a household where my parents were both physically, mentally and emotionally abusive to me. I wanted to kill myself at age five. My parents were both youth  pastors and prayed, encouraged and uplifted everyone at church. But behind closed doors. It was my hell. I survived suicide, alcoholism, depression and anxiety. I had really some serious trauma that I needed to work on. And learn how to love and be kind to myself. Admit my mistakes and confront my shame. Nearly killed me again. But made it out. Barley….
Now 33m I haven’t left my faith in God. And I promised my self once I have kids, I won’t be like my parents.
I just feel so sorry for her and the stress she endures. I see her and acknowledge her hardship. I hope she stays out all day today and relaxes.
So how can truly bring it home to my children. That they need to respect their mother?
EDIT #1: my gosh! My DMs are blowing up so positive and some bad. To the positive ones I am enjoying the conversation and all your advice. As well as sharing my life story with you. And hearing your stories as well!
To the bad dms and comments. I am sorry if it came across as me bragging or wanting kudos. This is not the case. I was just telling a story of my day. And legit wanted advice to be a better father.
EDIT #2 : some people are hung on the credit card situation. She has her own credit card. We just paid it off and mutually decided together to do all the big spending on mine. Since we are in a one income household. We kept catch ourselves getting into debt and not communicating properly when we made purchases. So 2024 this was our New Year’s resolution we decided to do together when it comes to credit cards
EDIT #3 : She did come back. I had a baby sitter on standby to watch the kids at night. And I took her to a nice relaxing restaurant and bought stuff at Ulta",

Like, extra appreciate him because this man? He’s the literal embodiment of “if he wanted to, he would.”
We’re in a semi-LDR situation. I’m based in Manila, he’s in California. but I’m also a flight attendant for US routes, so I see him almost every weekend due to work. We got married fairly quickly, but he’s been working SO hard to bring me over permanently. If you’ve dealt with visas, you know they require a mountain of money and proof that you can financially provide. And he’s doing all of that without ever making me feel like a burden.
We had a sweet little backyard wedding in the US, very wholesome, very romantic. But since only my mom could fly in, he promised me two weddings, one fulfilled the garden wedding dream(the us one) and another in the Philippines so I could have the family-filled, beachside celebration I’ve always imagined. He didn’t even blink at the idea. He offered.
On top of all that, he still takes me on dates. He spoils me. He bought us a house because I casually mentioned wanting a family someday. He never makes me pay for anything, not because I expect it, but because he wants to take care of me. And he does. In ways I never thought I’d get to experience.
If someone had told me three years ago that I’d be this loved, I honestly wouldn’t have believed it. I was so used to being the strong, self-sufficient one. But life surprised me in the most beautiful way with a husband who chooses me, shows up for me, and loves me so, so loudly.
I’m just really grateful.
TLDR: Married quick, semi-LDR with my US-based husband. He’s working hard to bring me over permanently, gave me a dream garden wedding and is planning a second beach wedding for my family. Buys me things, spoils me, even bought us a house. I’ve never felt so loved.

Somehow even when she’s sleeping, she registers what’s going on in the outside world. I, on the other hand, have sleep problems so I’m usually up later than she is. Some reports:
If I kiss her while she’s asleep, she always kisses back.
If I tell her I love her while she’s asleep, she says it back. Bonus: if I whisper it, she whispers back too.
If I shift around on the bed and get close to her shoulder, she kisses my forehead immediately.
If I ask to cuddle, she immediately puts her arms around me and kisses me.
Every time, she does this and goes right back to sleep. She’s only conscious for that split second it takes to respond. She has no memory of this in the morning. It makes me feel so special and safe.",

And I’ll tell you why I never made him another one after that.
He simply didn’t use them. Months passed by and I kept asking him why he didn't use them, but he’d just smile and say, “Nah.”
I thought maybe my gift hadn’t impressed him. So I stopped myself from asking him about it to the point I forgot about its existence.
Until one day, he finally used one.
On weekend, in the afternoon, he took me to the restaurant we always went to. Before we walked in, he suddenly handed me the coupon book.
He showed me the last coupon in the book. The most special one I made, the fill-in-the-blank coupon.
I want ________.
(Note: Fill in anything you want. One-time use only.)
He’d written:
You to go have fun with your friends today.
I stared at him, confused. He just muttered ""sorry"", patted my head, smiled, and led me to a table where my friends were sitting.
That’s when I finally understood.
My best friends had planned a meetup. I’d wanted to go but decided not to, because I didn’t want to miss a weekend with him. Every time we said goodbye, we’d already start counting the days until the next weekend, until we could see each other again. So, with a heavy heart, I told my friends to go ahead without me.
I never mentioned it to him, but somehow he found out through one of them.
He greeted them all, introduced himself politely to the one who came from out of town, then said goodbye. Before leaving, he quietly slipped his card into my hand and whispered to me to use it to treat my friends.
My friends didn’t make things awkward, even though they knew I’d chosen him over them before. We had such a good time that day. That memory has stayed with me ever since.
I had hope for him to make use the coupons so I could help him with chores. Even though he was always busy with work, he still cleaned his apartment by himself. He wouldn’t even let me do the dishes because he knew my hands were sensitive to dish soap. He just used that one coupon and let the others expired.
In the end, he used his most precious coupon for me. I feel cheated.. but in the sweetest way possible.","['https://preview.redd.it/uhpj2fjv3wxf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=11c67ef1d496486586b8933d32c3691d27c336c3', 'https://preview.redd.it/pyhzv6uv3wxf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=6e627c2cfba7666e35b763dc37782efecd929a50', 'https://preview.redd.it/qsu6b92v3wxf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=282cbae910eaf9397cec803aa706910aeeeca214', 'https://preview.redd.it/5ix9bt4w3wxf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=19dc83f98faad5124819c87b2512d30bc4c4f673', 'https://preview.redd.it/tuzj4hmy3wxf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=852a494374a63e1ba94691cb80ccf7b19257d59a', 'https://preview.redd.it/j70l5d3z3wxf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=611359ffc06036c34ace25f4d65a4e68320bb561', 'https://preview.redd.it/n2qpichx3wxf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=b19759add4a6cbcd655f265886e88c6eaa86213b', 'https://preview.redd.it/eiptsoww3wxf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=6ad90a16e619de0d93140603a938c9f34465a523', 'https://preview.redd.it/7qs39xfw3wxf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=f82cd29a8a06f1f0ec809b1652806e97ffc14214', 'https://preview.redd.it/xwv6b1ox3wxf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=e9f4a2b3d1cbbe4659f5e9c0e0e982b42dea3e14', 'https://preview.redd.it/kqntguty3wxf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=5f96ec8958baad41dc3989b6b96b4d7124b698b6', 'https://preview.redd.it/5zn5a73x3wxf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=a6be8af44b2b7f447af8bd2196130f3402ee4d24', 'https://preview.redd.it/kcd6h8ax3wxf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=3a5be851cebdc3886491dc40f70ccb9ee6cf24d7', 'https://preview.redd.it/4medmdyx3wxf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=dde9eb6f787eb669516c8e6472e55062a53fb1f5', 'https://preview.redd.it/3sn94e9y3wxf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=5db5d2712bf83ffcc3778f8aa808fb793f8425bb', 'https://preview.redd.it/wu3tlrnw3wxf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=354c56a8fe2b5c5f92b7c761f498194db8f11dfe', 'https://preview.redd.it/l309v2gy3wxf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=3f61e669f32e5fd29be0c0b26f469aeb4e4c9628']"

He was just sleeping. His reaction melted me.,"Backstory: I am diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. So yes, I have a problem, and I am actively working on it through medications and therapy.
My boyfriend always calls me before he goes to sleep. If for some reason he falls asleep without calling, which is very rare, I call him before I go to sleep which has always woken him up. (We only sleep apart from each other once a week).
Tonight for about an hour I couldn’t get a hold of him. Thinking back on it, rationally I should have realized he was probably deeply sleeping as he didn’t get much sleep the night before. But my anxiety convinced me he was dead somewhere.
So my call finally woke him up and I just was a sobbing, blubbering mess. He didn’t once berate me, make excuses, or make me feel stupid. He just apologized (he had nothing to apologize for) and reassured me. I told him i felt crazy. He said that is not true. He told me that my anxiety is part of me and he loves all of me, even the anxiety.
I’ve never felt so reassured and safe. This man understands everything about me, even the parts I don’t truly understand fully. He understands my anxiety without ever having experienced it himself. He amazes me every day.",

She has been very sleepy, hungry, and affectionate lately. I love cooking meals for her and our baby. I love all the extra cuddles and kisses we share. She has no baby bump yet but has put on a little weight. I think she is more beautiful than ever.
She already woke me up a week ago when she had a craving. I made sure I was ready for her the next time that happened. Sure enough, she woke me at three this morning. I saw tears in her eyes and panicked. When I asked what was wrong, she told me she could not sleep. All she could think about was chocolate.
I started laughing. She looked upset, but I told her to hold on a minute. I had stashed some of her favorite chocolates where I knew she would never find them. When I gave them to her, her eyes lit up and she hugged me tightly. Seeing her smile and enjoy her candy was the cutest thing ever.
We cuddled after and kept giggling about how absurd that moment was. She fell asleep before long, but I stayed up a while and held her. Her quiet snoring may be my favorite sound. It embarrasses her, but I find it adorable. I love my girlfriend so much. We had some rough patches, but I am happy we found each other again. She is my everything.",

She's a doctor, grasps concepts after just a single round of practice, and can throw snark and sarcasm without missing a beat. She has a plan for every situation, and it's honestly inspiring how all that planning is backed by sheer willpower and stubbornness. She's also super talented and plays the piano almost like a pro despite only practicing for a few months (even her trainer says that she's one of his most talented students.)
But when she's around me she just ""turns off,"" to the point where I need to walk her around as she clings onto me and sometimes literally pull her out of traffic. Even cuter, she goes from full sentences to lovey-dovey talk or excitedly tripping over her words to tell me about her interests or how her day went, which makes me absolutely melt. Sometimes when she's really tired she just collapses in my arms and we just cuddle together whilst making weird/funny noises at each other.
I love how she's not afraid to show me both sides- the mature medical professional as well as the 2013 Tumblr girl. I love how she feels comfortable enough to relax to this extent around me, and there's nothing more I want in life than to be her safe room where she can vent and release and be herself without worrying about being judged.",
love,https://old.reddit.com/r/love/comments/18wxs3b/today_i_learned_grief_is_the_toll_we_pay_for_love/,1983,280,Today I learned grief is the toll we pay for love.,"I sit here in tears today grieving the end of my 8 year relationship.
We met as strangers on the internet. We had our first FaceTime just a day after exchanging emails. I’ll never forget it. We are just 5 years apart in age.
8 months later we signed a lease on our first apartment together. It was nicer than anything either of us had ever stayed in. It was our home.
We texted everyday “I love you” and “I love you more”. It was unlike any relationship I had ever had. It felt safe, and l felt loved. Sure we have our arguments but it tore us both apart to not be connected. The arguing would end in “I’m sorry” and “I hate being apart from you”.
The pandemic hit and while many couples hated being locked up together, we found ways to have fun. We would shoot nerf guns at red solo cups we setup as targets. We started saving to buy a house.
Then one day I got a message through Facebook from someone who said I was being cheated on. Sure enough it was true. My heart broke. I decided to forgive and we moved on.
We got engaged, we bought our first house and took the in laws to Italy. Life was good but I had trust issues which then affected our sex life. We went to therapy but we still argued.
And then late in 2023 I get a text from another person letting me know I’ve been cheated on. It was true. That’s when I ended it.
Of course I’m leaving so many details out because I don’t want this to be a longer post than it already is but I want to say this to all of you looking for love…
1) love with your whole heart. Love deep. Love is a risk and if I had the choice to do this all over again knowing how it would end, I would. But I’d still leave. True vulnerable love is the most beautiful and fullfilling feeling you can have.
2) don’t take any moment for granted. Looking back, I did. I assumed that we’d always have each other and I regret focusing on work so much.
3) no one is perfect. Own up to how you played a part in any arguments. Remember why you love each other.
And I’ll leave you with this…you’ll know if you truly loved because in the end (whether death or breakup) you’ll have to pay the toll and it’s grief. And it’s deep deep grief but it’s so worth it.
Edit: to everyone telling me to get therapy, just stop. My post isn’t about asking for your help. Everyone’s journey is different and I alone made a very conscious choice to remain in my relationship. I’m not blaming anyone for my choices. That’s what being an adult is. My post left out many details for brevity sake so I’ll mention here that the heavy grief is being felt on both sides. We hold each other and cry so hard some nights. Yes we still live together. I move this week.",

My husband is next to me currently. He has a habit of rolling over in his sleep and cuddling me. He's never aware of it nor remembers. However tonight I'm reminded of when we first met. Earlier today he mentioned that he's at peace when he's near me. And for some reason I couldn't figure out why that perplexed me.
Well just a few minutes ago I remembered when we first met. I remember when he hugged me. To comfort me. He said he was at peace and that his soul felt drawn to me even though we had just met.
I have tears rolling down my face now.  I read that that feeling can be described as ""coming home"". Because that means whatever he had been searching for he found in me. And whenever he drifts off he searches for me subconsciously. 
I do NOT deserve this man but I'm grateful for him every day.

The crazy thing is that she is so into me that even objectably lame things that I like have become ""cool"" to her. I found a ""ManBat"" while thrifting action figure, a batman villain and she wouldn't stop talking about how happy she was I found it, and then when I was on a video call with my buddy she couldn't help but show off my find.

I was feeling sad over something irrelevant and at the time I was living away from my mom in a different city. I came home and she immediately noticed. She didn’t even ask what happened the only thing she said to me was that she knew and that she was there for me
Through a clenched throat and gutted tears my mom told me that above even my dad that she felt like I was her soulmate. She told me that she felt like she waited her entire life for me to come to her and that no one else she’s ever been close to has had such a connection to her that she’s had with me
This obviously made me immediately start to cry and i told her I felt the exact same way and that I feel like we had probably been through multiple lives together  while hugged and both had tears running down our face.
I don’t know, I know it feels probably dry to type this out but I didn’t  know where to share it. Lucky me that my mom said this to me but I just feel like it goes to show, you dont always have to meet the “right person” to find this kind of love and connection. Sometimes, they’re right there next you in your family.
This being said, going into the new year I feel so incredibly lucky to be alive and to have felt something like this in my life. I hope anyone who reads this feels loved and knows that they really are the center of someone’s universe and that there’s no definition of what a soulmate should look like.
If you love someone tell them, and make that a priority in your life no matter who it is, there’s too much hatred that exists out there otherwise. Big love going out to everyone in the new year, you deserve it more than anything else.",

I know it’s such a small gesture (and it is definitely not the first time he’s done something so thoughtful) but after a rough week, it made me cry.

It took about 15 minutes for me to get the food, but when I came out she said “I knew they were going to make you wait!” I think I just laughed and walked away. Idk.
Then she calls out to me and says “hey, would a hug make you feel better” I was fine so I’m not sure what she meant but I told her she could if she wanted to. Then we hugged and before she walked away, she gave me a kiss on the neck and said something about getting more tips.
Now this wasn’t like a sloppy love making kiss, it was more like a quick peck. But it literally didn’t make sense what happened. I’m not good looking, I’m not fit, I don’t stand out. Only thing I can think of is that maybe she was drunk. But it was the middle of the day so I’m not sure.

This happened 2 days ago
I, 29M have a really close friend 29F. We've been friends since 20. We hang out most often and have sleepovers. She's kinda socially awkward and we're each other's best friend. We watch movies together, have drinks, beer mostly and share everything with each other, fight occasionally too. Even our parents mistook us for a couple, but we never imagined it in our wildest dreams.
All these times we never had any feelings to each other, at least that's what I thought and we have not dated anyone else. A year ago unexpectedly we started sleeping together, we became FWB. People say its really bad to be FWB with your best friend but in our case it dint ruin our friendship or made anything weird. Actually we sleep together and for us it was very casual, like playing a video game together.
And last month things took a turn. I went to her apartment (she's hardly 2 kilometers away) to hangout as usual and she seemed upset.
She was pregnant!
She cried to me, apologized but I tried to be a supportive friend. I dint blame her or anything cuz it's my responsibility too. Although I acted brave with her I've never slept a wink till yesterday.
Thought of having a kid terrified me (she was too). We haven't told our mum and dad yet but we're telling them tomorrow.
To the incident of today, for the last month I have been contemplating on my life till that time, about why I'm still single, why we've been sleeping together etc. At some point at night, I imagined a situation some guy marries a girl he made pregnant and suddenly I don't know why I replaced those people with us. That moment, I thought about how my life would be if we were a couple. I felt a little joy inside. I think that's how everyone feels about a person the love. I thought about all of our interactions for the last few years and it hit me hard why others took us for a couple. I was startled and felt awkward when I realised I have feelings for my best friend. I was really tensed, we're both strangers to romance and I was terribly scared to tell her.
Some thing happened an hour ago, following and someone on reddit, I talked to her, mustering all the courage I can. I thought she will freak out and we never speak to each other again.
But she wept, hugging me. She couldn't even speak properly when she said she loved me all this time, for years. I couldn't stop shedding some tears too even though I tried to look tough.
She told me she was scared sick I might reject her. Said she always dropped hints.(I swear dint even realise it.) When I told her she said, ""You son of a b**ch I've been loving you for over six years""!. I could not not drop my jaw.
Anyway we promised to raise the kid together and make our relationship official and go on a date tomorrow evening. We don't know shit about dating but we are very optimistic about our future.
I don't know if there will be a marriage in the future but we sure see us together.

We are in the middle of planning a wedding, and I’ve had a really bad situation with a coworker being inappropriate. It’s been a really stressful time.

I’m not used to people being willing to put in work in a relationship. I’ve been left a lot. I’ve been afraid he would leave me with everything going on. We closed on our house on Wednesday, and due to a clerical error his name got left off all the documents. We have to go back in six weeks and pay a 200 dollar fee to add his name to the house. He could leave me at anytime because currently, he’s free and clear. I’m the only one stuck.
We don’t have any furniture yet. We have been sleeping on the floor. It hurts his back and he’s been saying how uncomfortable sleeping on the floor is. So. ....We borrowed an air mattress from a friend. It’s SMOL. I’m used to sleeping on the floor. I lived in my car for a year. It’s not the most comfortable. But I can tolerate it pretty well. I let him sleep on the air mattress last night because I wanted him to be comfortable. Or bed is supposed to get delivered Monday.
This morning, I woke up with him next to me on the floor. Snuggled up against my back. He said he couldn’t wait until Monday to sleep next to me. He slept on the floor just to cuddle me.  I’m full of doubts and insecurities but he always seems to make them better. I cried this morning when he said that. We may be going through an extremely stressful time right now but I love him and he loves me. I slept on the floor so he could be comfortable. He slept on the floor because he wasn’t comfortable without me.

I found it yesterday in an album; I hadn't seen it for a number of years.  We had been married and living together for at least six months before we actually had our wedding ceremony...the delay was mainly for logistical reasons.  The picture is from the middle of our honeymoon trip that we started a few days after the ceremony.
In our hotel room in Papeete before heading out for the day
It is hard for me to look at this photo and not feel terribly nostalgic.  Being so young and happy and optimistic and so much in romantic love.
We are both 26 in this picture, and my wife passed away when she was 40, but this post is not about that, at least, as much as I can separate what I feel about different types of love from my specific feelings of missing her.
I did eventually remarry, to a wonderful woman who I also loved (and still do...she is my current wife).  And she loves me.  I was overall happy being married the first time, so I think it was only natural that I be open to remarrying, and I was fortunate to find a second someone who would take this weirdo that I am (and my three children) into her heart and choose to make a life with me (us).
But even if my first wife was still alive, it is inevitable that love matures and evolves.  The realities of raising children and finances and responsibilities and obligations inevitably turns life from a fairy tale into ...well, life.
I have no way to know, but if my wife in the picture above was still here and 61, would she still snuggle in tight for a photo, cheek to cheek, one arm draped over my shoulder and the other carelessly resting on my leg?  Well, perhaps she would, because I have noticed that in photos of the two of us, she *always* is holding my arm or touching my shoulder or otherwise making physical contact with me...she was very good at just naturally posing in an unforced, intimate manner.
But momentary photos aside, I know from the 14 years that we did spend together that of course we were not the same young lovey-dovey newlyweds at 39 that we were at 26.  And I know that is the natural course of things.
But I really enjoyed that time, that kind of love.  The yearning when apart, the pleasure of shopping for a special romantic gift, the love letters, the affectionate nicknames, leaving silly notes on the kitchen table before going off to work...I do have to admit it makes me sad that I won't experience that sort of love again.
There is nothing stopping me from doing similar things now, other than the fact that my current wife is a different individual with her own style and desires and needs, and most of those things would evoke eye rolls more than a smile.  Romantic, playful love is not really on her menu, if I am frank.  And that is OK, because our love is no less genuine...it is just different...calmer, maybe.  The product of a different time of life, different circumstances.
But I  guess I am lucky to have been so lucky, twice.",

I've always loved him but lately I feel like I'm just head over heels for him like when we were younger. My stomach gets butterflies and I almost feel sick just from thinking about him, like the jitters you get before you meet up with a new boyfriend. When we are in a room together I can feel the electricity between us almost like a magnet just pulling us together. During Thanksgiving I couldn't help looking at him from across the room and doing little things to catch his attention. I think he feels it too, as he's been very vocal about wanting me and any chance he gets he'll come up and touch me or kiss me. He's always been more affectionate than me but lately it's been taken up several notches. I've caught him several times staring at me, checking me out, and looking love struck. Complimenting and asking why I'm moving a certain way and why I'm teasing him when to me I'm just going about doing my normal chores.

As she spoke through the tears, she said she didn't want me to go and that she loved me so much. I just held her for what seemed like forever and I just rocked her back and forth on my lap for over an hour as she cried and I consoled her.
I loved this girl more than anything. We just cuddled until her sobs turned into smiles and I told her I was going to marry her someday (we have talked about this before) she just smiled and hugged me.

Some backstory, I’ve known him since around February. I met him in one of my classes and I could instantly tell he was shy/introverted/a little awkward which didn’t bother me. I started talking to him originally about the class and the worksheets we had but then it switched to different things like some things we enjoy.
Well since about the beginning of may, I started to catch feelings for him. I know it’s taken him that long to open up by I feel like that’s a big part of my initial crush for him. I’ve seen him open up to me from hiding in his shell all the time to coming out and showing me his true self. I feel so special knowing I’m one of the only people on this planet who can see who this shy, sweet, intelligent guy really is. It was around that time that I started to realize what a hidden gem I had discovered.
So a couple months go by, my crush seemingly getting bigger with each passing day. Until I finally decided to just go and ask him out on a date. Nothing special or fancy, it was just us two at Dave and busters. Even his reaction was adorable! When I asked him, his cheeks flushed red and he had a smile on that he couldn’t wipe off.
Everything went amazingly well during the date! I dressed in a nice pair of jeans and a nice shirt which got another cute reaction out of him. He blushed when he saw me and was a little speechless because he’d never seen me dressed up.
We got some food to eat and we played a bunch of games throughout the store until we headed back home. I held his hand as we walked back to the valet. Again he blushed, smiled, and gave my hand a little squeeze. I seriously can’t get enough of his reactions to doing little things like when I kissed him goodbye, It was like a computer resetting with tons of blushing cheeks🥰.
He actually told me I was special to him because of the date and also the fact that I was the only person who decided to stick around and watch him come out of his shell and open up to someone. He likes that I’d invite him to go eat somewhere or hangout after class made a difference to him which is why around mid-April he started having feelings for me too.
Ugh I seriously can’t get enough of that boy and how the smallest sign of affection will make him all happy and blush. It makes me feel special too because my previous partners wouldn’t care for those little acts of affection where it makes his week if I kiss him. 🥰🥰 I’m just so happy right now 😊",

My husband and I recently moved into a little tin can of a trailer. (I love her, she's a wonderful little box.)
While we were unpacking, my husband found a picture of himself as a little tyke with his old baseball team. Maybe six years old.
He handed me the picture with a little smirk, and asked me to pick him out of the group.
Immediately, I noticed that one child was just adorably beautiful. He looked like a little doll. Soft, sweet features. Just. ADORABLE. But I thought, no no. I can't just pick the prettiest one.
So I looked for the most mischievous looking kid, and pointed. He laughed, and told me to try again.
I said, ""Wait, you aren't ACTUALLY just the prettiest one, are you!?"" Of course, dude was a bit flabbergasted, and asked, ""What???""
I pointed to the prettiest one, and said, ""That one!!! The one that looks like a damn child model!"" That was, indeed, my husband. And he was flustered for the next hour or so, lol.

We hadn't seen each other in a couple days but had been fighting mainly over the phone, and the next time we saw each other it was with a group of people, so we didn't really get a chance to air it out in person until later that night. When we were finally alone and he got into my bedroom, I sighed and closed the door, ready to hash it out with him. Really give him a piece of my mind, yknow? I took off my jacket though and he just stared at me and my cute outfit, took off his glasses, then came up and kissed me so passionately I nearly melted into the floor. He basically told me he was sorry but he couldn't stop himself because I looked so good and he loved and missed me.
Guys.
Guys.
Honestly despite rehearsing what I was going to say to him beforehand, I completely forgot my whole speech. I completely forgot what the dumb fight was even about. Hell I'm pretty sure for a while there, I completely forgot my own name. I think I blacked out for a bit because my heart was beating so fast. I felt like freaking anastasia steele when she was kissed in that elevator (fifty shades is a terrible movie but that scene was hot af).
And because we don't really like having sex without fixing our issues, we managed to keep our hands off eachother for long enough to laugh about what a stupid fight we were having and to really discuss it all. He triple checked with me that I was okay with everything before proceeding to blow my mind again...if you know what I mean.

He said he was falling out of love with me, and he doesn't think he'll ever be in the same mental state to love me again. I asked if he was willing to go to couples therapy or therapy in general. He doesn't think anything will help.
To be honest, there were signs. He became distant. We would still have good chats, but he rarely initiated physical intimacy (hugs, kisses). He would rarely initiate sex either. He told me, at one point, he was trying to avoid me.
It hurts. It hurts being the person who still has so much love to work and fight for the relationship, but not getting any of that back. It hurts not being able to grow old with him, to grow with him, to face any challenges with him. It hurts watching him pull away, and me playing it off as tiredness.
I hate feeling this way. It feels like a rug was pulled under me. It's hard to fight back the tears.

We hugged for a while since we were both feeling a bit sad about not being able to sleep together that night. During the hug, I joked, “If you start crying, I’m going to laugh.” She looked at me with tears already on her face and said, “Too late.” We both ended up laughing at her crying.

Yesterday at work, I got an offer for a job contract which would require me to move across the country for 2 years. I knew in myself that it was a good opportunity, but ultimately I turned it down.
I called my girlfriend last night and told her that I got the offer, and that I was considering taking it, partially as a joke. As soon as those words left my mouth, I noticed that she got really quiet and I asked her what was wrong. I noticed tears in her eyes, and she started crying. I immediately felt terrible and apologised. In that moment, I truly realised how much I meant to her, and how much it would hurt if I was to not be around in her life. I told her that she had no need to worry and that I wasn’t going anywhere anytime soon. She said to me that she could not imagine a life without me, and my heart melted.
We spent the rest of the night talking and planning our first romantic getaway in the countryside, and she told me how excited she was to sit by a campfire and watch the stars with me.  Honestly, I had no idea that she loved me this much. And it hurts me so much as well imagining a life without her. I love her so damn much.
Edit: Wow I did not expect this post to blow up like this! Thank you everyone for your kind words and insights!!
I just wanted to clarify a few things. Firstly, although when I wrote this it sounds like I turned down the opportunity purely because of her, that’s not entirely true. The opportunity was not anything that would boost my career anymore than the role I have now, and honestly I have a great living situation where I am now and wasn’t willing to sacrifice it. Secondly, after she cried, she did express that she was thinking of options to be closer to me if I took the opportunity. We also discussed other options if other opportunities like this arose. I know it’s early, but things are looking up so far!",
love,https://old.reddit.com/r/love/comments/1oci2of/the_second_year_anniversary_with_my_husband_and_i/,1360,87,The second year anniversary with my husband and I just wanted to state how much I love him!,"Two years married. I moved 3,000 miles to be with him, and I have no regrets. Here’s to us, my love, and to many more years of embraces and happiness. You’ve made my move and my time here in the UK beautiful. You’ve been by my side when I missed home, when I missed who I was before I moved, and for that, I’m grateful. I’m very lucky to have an amazing man like you in my life. I pray for your happiness, success, and health every day. Each day, you make me laugh until I can’t breathe; you make me feel beautiful in ways no one else ever could. Most of all, you make me realize that I was worthy of the love I always wanted, because you give it to me every day 🩷
I love you, my zindagi",https://i.redd.it/7svlvypvuhwf1.jpeg

We are going to die once he opens the door but I don't care because I'm just happy he's around so this must be love.
EDIT: I wasn't expecting this to blow up the way it did lmao, I know it's gross but love is beautiful and sometimes gross. Sometimes love is cuddling while watching movies and sometimes love is finding out the gorgeous guy you met at a wine bar a year and a half ago can and will gas you in your own home and choosing to cuddle with him afterwards in spite of it all. Appreciate all y'all who feel the same :') And yes we do have poo pourri and it definitely works but I did forget to put a new bottle in the bathroom so if I'm being honest I'm responsible too lol.",
love,https://old.reddit.com/r/love/comments/18vd6l9/something_to_think_about_when_going_into_2024we/,1349,115,"Something to think about when going into 2024...We don't talk nearly enough about ""papercuts"" in a relationship....","Everytime there's raised voices, cruel words, lack of support, short temper, lack of affection, etc., a tiny wound is created. Not enough to make you leave, but enough to make part of you pull away & lose a little love everytime. One day those wounds create a chasm so deep its unfixable. 
What isn't a ""big deal"" to you today could be a chasm tomorrow. Nurture your partner, walk with gentleness, & apologize freely. It's much easier than living with regret at the edge of a chasm.",

He’s such a blessing to me and I’m grateful to be engaged to him after a year of dating ❤️❤️❤️",https://i.redd.it/1jo0p99au5ud1.jpeg
love,https://old.reddit.com/r/love/comments/h98few/i_forgot_that_relationships_are_supposed_to_make/,1340,51,I forgot that relationships are supposed to make you feel better about yourself.,"I spent six years with somebody who was the least affectionate, least willing to compromise person I’ve ever met. He didn’t touch me. He didn’t cuddle me or hold my hand. I counted once and he kissed me twice in one month. He rarely told me he loved me. We went on dates maybe once every few months, and he’d complain the whole time. Begging for the absolute bare minimum for years from the person who claims to be in love with you does horrible things to your self esteem, and I didn’t even realize it until I got out of it.
Now I’m with someone else, a man that I’ve been best friends with for five years. Whereas my ex wouldn’t even tell
me
he loved me, this man constantly tells other people how in love with me he is. My ex never wanted to hold my hand, but I never get in a car with this man wherein he doesn’t hold my hand. I get told I’m pretty constantly. My ex used to complain about going to dinner or the movies; this man has asked to take me into the city for dinner and a symphony, to have sex with me on a hotel balcony overlooking the beach, to take me out to California to show me things he saw on his visit years ago. I get good morning texts. Every door I ever approach is opened for me. I told him once what my dream engagement ring would be while we were both absolutely plastered, and the next day when we’d sobered up he listed off everything I’d said I liked. If I even mention I might like it, he’s already bought it for me. He checks and changes my oil because he knows I’ll never remember to do it myself and never lets me go to work without caffeine because he knows I’ll have a headache. I’m so taken care of.
I forgot what it feels like to have a relationship that makes you feel better. I’m smiling for no reason. Coworkers have commented on it. I feel prettier. I try harder. My house is cleaner. I have a generally better attitude. I’m sleeping better. I am so fucking STOKED to be in this relationship.
I have to marry him. He’s it. I just know it.",

He is unaware that I’m the one who did it. Apparently it was his first award on here. It’s a small thing really, but it was still cute to see him giddy like that. He brushes it off in person, but I’ve got the message that shows how he really felt lol.
Sorry if this seems stupid. It just tickled me to know that small act made him happy.
Edit: thank you all for the upvotes and everything lol. I didn’t realize this post would gain so much traction, so I was worried for a bit that my bf would see this and know it was me, but there has been no mention of the award since posting this so I think I’m in the clear! Would have added this sooner but since this is my second account, I don’t see what all goes on here unless I switch over to it.",
love,https://old.reddit.com/r/love/comments/ir9evr/my_boyfriend_carried_me_to_a_hotel_room_while_i/,1335,17,My boyfriend carried me to a hotel room while I was sleeping,"Me (f24) and my boyfriend (m21) went on a visit to his parents house as we haven't seem them in so long. The car drive there was around two days, and we saw lots of sights and enjoyed every moment of it.
My favorite memory was when we where in the middle of the desert on an empty road. All we ahead of us was pitch black and the tail light. After hours of talking and listening to music,  I start to fall asleep in the passenger seat but wake up shortly after to him singing to songs I had no idea he was interested in, word for word. I pretended to still be asleep because seeing him happy made me feel happy inside.
An hour later he pulls up to a hotel, got all our stuff into a room and then came to me. He still had no idea I was awake (I think) and he carried me between his arms to the room. He was struggling but it was still super cute! He lied me down, tucked me in, and kissed me on my forehead. After that, I he fell right into the bed next to me, with all his clothes still on . I kept staring at him the whole night.
When I woke up my heart was filled. I went to cuddle him and he acted so confused to why I was so happy. Looking back at it, he probably did know I was awake, but I didn't want to ruin it. :)",
love,https://old.reddit.com/r/love/comments/qjpdz6/my_boyfriend_went_above_and_beyond_taking_care_of/,1330,47,"My boyfriend went above and beyond taking care of me when I was sick, even after we had a huge fight.","I don’t really know who else to share this with, but I just really wanted to tell someone about this.
Friday evening my boyfriend and I got into a huge, huge fight that ended with me leaving in tears. No yelling, no verbal abuse, nothing. Just very emotional.
I must have caught a stomach bug or ate something bad, because Friday night til Saturday evening, I was vomiting my guts out. I literally couldn’t move a muscle without having to puke.
I texted my boyfriend that I was feeling awful and he immediately rushed over with medicine. He built me a little bed next to the toilet, rushed out for some stomach safe food, held my hand while I shivered with a fever. He swaddled me when I was freezing, held ice to my head when I was burning up. He ran out to grab some stomach safe food again and gave me ice chips.
I wanted to apologize for my part in our fight and he just stroked my hair and said everything was okay. I asked him if he was mad and he said no, he was just worried about me. And that he would always love and support me, no matter what.
I have never felt so supported in my entire life. So completely accepted and fully and deeply loved. It’s nice, knowing that I have someone who is in my corner unconditionally.",

While waiting for some of my family members to arrive, my GF and I were cuddling in my room with me on top of her while she ran her fingers through my hair. It was the first time I’ve ever felt such an immense feeling of comfort, safety, and happiness that I, no matter how hard I tried, started to cry. My GF obviously noticed and asked me what was wrong. Out of embarrassment, I didn’t want to answer and hugged her tighter instead. I guess she understood since she began to comfort me and began to whisper in my ear how much she loved and appreciated me. Today, she texted me and asked me if I got emotional because of something she said or did wrong, and I reassured her it was the opposite and explained the real reason. She then told me she always wanted to make me feel safe, cherished, and loved, and that she was very happy I was vulnerable with her. I’ll never know what I did to deserve such a loving and amazing girlfriend, but I really, really love her and always will. Just wanted to share this for y’all, thanks for reading!",
love,https://old.reddit.com/r/love/comments/1o5wfrg/it_cost_less_than_5_to_create_a_core_memory/,1306,18,It cost less than $5 to create a core memory,"People tend to have the notion that “grand gestures” have to be expensive, extravagant, and unattainable, but this is your PSA that the most meaningful acts don’t have to cost much, if anything.
This weekend, my boyfriend turned 32. He had it pretty rough growing up, and wasn’t often celebrated in his home or by his family. He doesn’t care much about his birthday- why buy a gift? Why go out? Who cares, it’s just another day on the calendar.
I care. It’s not just another day to me.
It cost exactly $4.16 to buy some balloons and a couple numeral candles to place on a breakfast casserole I made, since he’s not super into sweets. In the early morning hours of his birthday, it cost less than thirty minutes of my time to sneakily blow up balloons in the next room with his daughter, both of us giggling, excited and anticipating his reaction.
Yes, the gifts and cards cost extra; and I suppose the ingredients for the breakfast I made. The “happy birthday” banner was free from previous use. But for less than $5, I got to surprise my love with a room full of balloons and see his smile light up with joy. I got to celebrate him, and remind him he is worth celebrating, which costs nothing really. Yet it’s so priceless.
This is your reminder to go the extra mile for the ones you love. Cherish them, celebrate them, adore them, and remind them what a blessing they are to your life. It feels so good ❤️",https://i.redd.it/ivyjlcr63yuf1.jpeg

Happy 29th birthday to me. I hope to celebrate it online with you guys. If I had money on me I’d walk to the store and get myself cake or even a pie and sing myself happy birthday. But I’m not dwelling on the sad stuff today and only hoping for a better new journey for me. Here’s to 29 and happy birthday to me💃🏾
Update:
Honestly I never thought Reddit would in any way make me feel so loved and special. When I posted this I was so happy to have 3 people respond and then it just blew up from there. You guys are all amazing! You’ve taken the time out of your day to wish me a total stranger a happy birthday and believe me when I say you all made it the best birthday ever! For this I am grateful. For this I am thankful. I would have cried myself to sleep but  instead I took your advice, celebrated myself by popping popcorn and watching a movie&later BBT. Fell asleep in the middle of doing so and woke up to more messages! I had one friend reach out, a former classmate and the security guard from my former university via Facebook. Honestly redditors this world is a better place with all you in it! Thank you so much for making me feel that I’m not alone. I wish to do the same for all of you. Thank you so very much❤️. 29th year journey around the sun begins.",

The vote saw 10 Republican members of Congress vote in favor of impeachment, along with all 222 Democrats.
This is the first time that a US President has been impeached twice during their presidency. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has stated that he does not plan on reconvening the Senate prior to January 19th, making it likely that the impeachment trial will take place during the beginning of President-elect Joseph R. Biden’s administration.

Over the past few months, we have been floored by the energy and creativity redditors have displayed in the effort to save net neutrality. It was inspiring to witness
organic takeovers
of the front page (twice), read touching
stories
about how net neutrality matters in users’ everyday lives, see bills about net neutrality
discussed on the front page
(with over 100,000 upvotes and cross-posts to over 100 communities), and watch redditors exercise their voices as citizens in the
hundreds of thousands of calls
they drove to Congress.
It is disappointing that the FCC Chairman plowed ahead with his planned repeal despite all of this
public concern
, not to mention the
objections expressed by his fellow commissioners
,
the FCC’s own CTO
,
more than a hundred members of Congress
,
dozens of senators, and the very builders of the modern internet
.
Nevertheless, today’s vote is the beginning, not the end. While the fight to preserve net neutrality is going to be longer than we had hoped, this is far from over.
Many of you have asked what comes next. We don’t exactly know yet, but it seems likely that the FCC’s decision will be challenged in court soon, and we would be supportive of that challenge. It’s also possible that Congress can decide to take up the cause and create strong, enforceable net neutrality rules that aren’t subject to the political winds at the FCC. Nevertheless, this will be a complex process that takes time.
What is certain is that Reddit will continue to be involved in this issue in the way that we know best: seeking out every opportunity to amplify your voices and share them with those who have the power to make a difference.
This isn’t the outcome we wanted, but you should all be proud of the awareness you’ve created. Those who thought that they’d be able to quietly repeal net neutrality without anyone noticing or caring learned a thing or two, and we still may come out on top of this yet. We’ll keep you informed as things develop.
u/arabscarab (Jessica, our head of policy) will also be in the comments to address your questions.

other activism

evidence
is clear that Net Neutrality is important to Americans of both parties (or no party at all), and today’s vote demonstrated that our Senators are hearing us.
We’ve still got a way to go, but today’s vote has provided us with some incredible momentum and energy to keep fighting.
We’re going to keep working with you all on this in the coming months, but for now, we just wanted to say thanks!",

It’s been a couple months since the FCC voted to repeal federal net neutrality regulations. We were all disappointed in the decision, but we told you we’d continue the fight, and we wanted to share an update on what you can do to help.
The debate has now moved to Congress, which is good news. Unlike the FCC, which is unelected and less immediately accountable to voters, members of Congress depend on input from their constituents to help inform their positions—especially during an election year like this one.
“But wait,” you say. “I already called my Congressperson last year, and we’re still in this mess! What’s different now?” Three words:
Congressional Review Act.
What is it?
The Congressional Review Act (CRA) is basically Congress’s downvote. It lets them undo the FCC’s order through a “resolution of disapproval.” This can be formally introduced in both the Senate and the House within 60 legislative days after the FCC’s order is officially published in the Federal Register, which happened last week. It needs a simple majority in both houses to pass. Our friends at Public Knowledge have made
a video explaining the process
.
What’s happening in Congress?
Now that the FCC order has been published in the Federal Register, the clock for the CRA is ticking. Members of both the House and Senate who care about Net Neutrality have already been securing the votes they need to pass the resolution of disapproval. In fact, the Senate version is only
#onemorevote
away from the 51 it needs to pass!
What should I do?
Today, we’re calling on you to phone your members of Congress and tell them what you think! You can see exactly where members stand on this issue so far on
this scoreboard
. If they’re already on board with the CRA, great! Thank them for their efforts and tell them you appreciate it. Positive feedback for good work is important.
If they still need convincing, here is a script to help guide your conversation:
“My name is ________ and I live in ______. I’m calling today to share my support for strong net neutrality rules. I’d like to ask Senator/Representative_______ to use the CRA to pass a resolution of disapproval overturning the FCC’s repeal of net neutrality.”
Pro tips:
-
Be polite
. That thing your grandma said about the flies and the honey and the vinegar is right. Remember, the people who disagree with us are the ones we need to convince.
-
Only call the Senators and Representatives who actually represent YOU
. Calls are most effective when they come from actual constituents. If you’re not sure who represents you or how to get in touch with them, you can look it up
here
.
-
If this issue affects you personally because of who you are or what you do, let them know!
Local business owner who uses the web to reach customers? Caregiver who uses telemedicine to consult patients? Parent whose child needs the internet for school assignments? Share that. The more we can put a human face on this, the better.
-
Don’t give up.
The nature of our democratic system means that things can be roundabout, messy, and take a long time to accomplish. Perseverance is key. We’ll be with you every step of the way.",
announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3cucye/an_old_team_at_reddit/,132248,19869,An old team at reddit,"Ellen Pao resigned from reddit today by mutual agreement.  I'm delighted to announce that Steve Huffman, founder and the original reddit CEO, is returning as CEO.
We are thankful for Ellen’s many contributions to reddit and the technology industry generally.  She brought focus to chaos, recruited a world-class team of executives, and drove growth.  She brought a face to reddit that changed perceptions, and is a pioneer for women in the tech industry.  She will remain as an advisor to the board through the end of 2015.  I look forward to seeing the great things she does beyond that.
We’re very happy to have Steve back.  Product and community are the two legs of reddit, and the board was very focused on finding a candidate who excels at both (truthfully, community is harder), which Steve does.  He has the added bonus of being a founder with ten years of reddit history in his head.  Steve is rejoining Alexis, who will work alongside Steve with the new title of “cofounder”.
A few other points.  Mods, you are what makes reddit great.  The reddit team, now with Steve, wants to do more for you.  You deserve better moderation tools and better communication from the admins.
Second, redditors, you deserve clarity about what the content policy of reddit is going to be.  The team will create guidelines to both preserve the integrity of reddit and to maintain reddit as the place where the most open and honest conversations with the entire world can happen.
Third, as a redditor, I’m particularly happy that Steve is so passionate about mobile.  I’m very excited to use reddit more on my phone.
As a closing note, it was sickening to see some of the things redditors wrote about Ellen. [1] The reduction in compassion that happens when we’re all behind computer screens is not good for the world.  People are still people even if there is Internet between you.
If the reddit community cannot learn to balance authenticity and compassion, it may be a great website but it will never be a truly great community.  Steve’s great challenge as CEO [2] will be continuing the work Ellen started to drive this forward.
[1] Disagreements are fine.  Death threats are not, are not covered under free speech, and will continue to get offending users banned.
Ellen asked me to point out that the sweeping majority of redditors didn’t do this, and many were incredibly supportive. Although the incredible power of the Internet is the amplification of voices, unfortunately sometimes those voices are hateful.
[2] We were planning to run a CEO search here and talked about how Steve (who we assumed was unavailable) was the benchmark candidate—he has exactly the combination of talent and vision we were looking for.  To our delight, it turned out our hypothetical benchmark candidate is the one actually taking the job.
NOTE: I am going to let the reddit team answer questions here, and go do an AMA myself now.",

–
Call your Senators
, then join us for an AMA with one.
EDIT:
Senator Markey's AMA is live now.
Hey Reddit, time for another update in the Net Neutrality fight!
When we
last checked in
on this in February, we told you about the
Congressional Review Act
, which allows Congress to undo the FCC’s repeal of Net Neutrality. That process took a big step forward today as the CRA petition was discharged in the Senate. That means a full Senate vote is likely soon, so let’s remind them that we’re watching!
Today, you’ll see sites across the web go on “RED ALERT”
in honor of this cause. Because this is Reddit, we thought that
Orangered
Alert was more fitting, but the call to action is the same. Join users across the web in
calling your Senators
(both of ‘em!) to let them know that you support using the Congressional Review Act to save Net Neutrality. You can learn more about the effort
here
.
We’re also delighted to share that Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts, the lead sponsor of the CRA petition, will be joining us for an AMA in
r/politics
today at 2:30 pm ET, hot off the Senate floor, so get your questions ready!
Finally, seeing
the creative ways the Reddit community gets involved
in this issue is always the best part of these actions. Maybe you’re the mod of a community that has organized something in honor of the day. Or you want to share something really cool that your Senator’s office told you when you called them up. Or maybe you’ve made the dankest of net neutrality-themed memes. Let us know in the comments!
There is strength in numbers, and we’ve pulled off the impossible before through simple actions just like this. So let’s give those Senators a big, Reddit-y hug.

As of today, the employee in question is no longer employed by Reddit. We built a relationship with her first as a mod and then through her contractor work on RPAN. We did not adequately vet her background before formally hiring her.
We’ve put significant effort into improving how we handle doxxing and harassment, and this employee was the subject of both. In this case, we over-indexed on protection, which had serious consequences in terms of enforcement actions.
On March 9th, we added extra protections for this employee, including actioning content that mentioned the employee’s name or shared personal information on third-party sites, which we reserve for serious cases of harassment and doxxing.
On March 22nd, a news article about this employee was posted by a mod of
r/ukpolitics
. The article was removed and the submitter banned by the aforementioned rules. When contacted by the moderators of
r/ukpolitics
, we reviewed the actions, and reversed the ban on the moderator, and we informed the
r/ukpolitics
moderation team that we had restored the mod.
We updated our rules to flag potential harassment for human review.
Debate and criticism have always been and always will be central to conversation on Reddit—including discussion about public figures and Reddit itself—as long as they are not used as vehicles for harassment. Mentioning a public figure’s name should not get you banned.
We care deeply for Reddit and appreciate that you do too. We understand the anger and confusion about these issues and their bigger implications. The employee is no longer with Reddit, and we’ll be evolving a number of relevant internal policies.
We did not operate to our own standards here. We will do our best to do better for you.",

post on Reddit
that included leaked documents from the UK. We investigated this account and the accounts connected to it, and today we believe this was part of a campaign that has been reported as originating from Russia.
Earlier this year Facebook discovered a
Russian campaign
on its platform, which was further analyzed by the Atlantic Council and dubbed “
Secondary Infektion
.” Suspect accounts on Reddit were recently reported to us, along with indicators from law enforcement, and we were able to confirm that they did indeed show a pattern of coordination. We were then able to use these accounts to identify additional suspect accounts that were part of the campaign on Reddit. This group provides us with important attribution for the recent posting of the leaked UK documents, as well as insights into how adversaries are adapting their tactics.
In late October, an account
u/gregoratior
posted the leaked documents and later reposted by an additional account
u/ostermaxnn
. Additionally, we were able to find a pocket of accounts participating in
vote manipulation
on the original post. All of these accounts have the same shared pattern as the original Secondary Infektion group detected, causing us to believe that this was indeed tied to the original group.
Outside of the post by
u/gregoratior
, none of these accounts or posts received much attention on the platform, and many of the posts were removed either by moderators or as part of normal content manipulation operations. The accounts posted in different regional subreddits, and in several different languages.
Karma distribution:
0 or less: 42
1 - 9: 13
10 or greater: 6
Max Karma: 48
As a result of this investigation, we are banning
1 subreddit
and 61 accounts under our policies against vote manipulation and misuse of the platform. As we have done with previous influence operations, we will also preserve these accounts for a time, so that researchers and the public can scrutinize them to see for themselves how these accounts operated.
EDIT: I'm signing off for the evening. Thanks for the comments and questions.

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/93qnm5/we_had_a_security_incident_heres_what_you_need_to/,73261,7426,We had a security incident. Here's what you need to know.,"TL;DR
: A hacker broke into a few of Reddit’s systems and managed to access some user data, including some current email addresses and a 2007 database backup containing old salted and hashed passwords. Since then we’ve been conducting a painstaking investigation to figure out just what was accessed, and to improve our systems and processes to prevent this from happening again.
What happened?
On June 19, we learned that between June 14 and June 18, an attacker compromised a few of our employees’ accounts with our cloud and source code hosting providers. Already having our primary access points for code and infrastructure behind strong authentication requiring two factor authentication (2FA), we learned that SMS-based authentication is not nearly as secure as we would hope, and the main attack was via SMS intercept.  We point this out to encourage everyone here to move to token-based 2FA.
Although this was a serious attack, the attacker did not gain write access to Reddit systems; they gained read-only access to some systems that contained backup data, source code and other logs. They were not able to alter Reddit information, and we have taken steps since the event to further lock down and rotate all production secrets and API keys, and to enhance our logging and monitoring systems.
Now that we've concluded our investigation sufficiently to understand the impact, we want to share what we know, how it may impact you, and what we've done to protect us and you from this kind of attack in the future.
What information was involved?
Since June 19, we’ve been working with cloud and source code hosting providers to get the best possible understanding of what data the attacker accessed. We want you to know about two key areas of user data that was accessed:
All Reddit data from 2007 and before including account credentials and email addresses
What was accessed:
A complete copy of an old database backup containing very early Reddit user data -- from the site’s launch in 2005 through May 2007. In Reddit’s first years it had many fewer features, so the most significant data contained in this backup are account credentials (username + salted
hashed
passwords), email addresses, and all content (mostly public, but also private messages) from way back then.
How to tell if your information was included:
We are sending a message to affected users and resetting passwords on accounts where the credentials might still be valid. If you signed up for Reddit after 2007, you’re clear here. Check your PMs and/or email inbox: we will be notifying you soon if you’ve been affected.
Email digests sent by Reddit in June 2018
What was accessed:
Logs containing the email digests we sent between June 3 and June 17, 2018. The logs contain the digest emails themselves -- they
look like this
. The digests connect a username to the associated email address and contain suggested posts from select popular and safe-for-work subreddits you subscribe to.
How to tell if your information was included:
If you don’t have an email address associated with your account or your “email digests” user preference was unchecked during that period, you’re not affected. Otherwise, search your email inbox for emails from [
noreply@redditmail.com
](mailto:
noreply@redditmail.com
) between June 3-17, 2018.
As the attacker had read access to our storage systems, other data was accessed such as Reddit source code, internal logs, configuration files and other employee workspace files, but these two areas are the most significant categories of user data.
What is Reddit doing about it?
Some highlights. We:
Reported the issue to law enforcement and are cooperating with their investigation.
Are messaging user accounts if there’s a chance the credentials taken reflect the account’s current password.
Took measures to guarantee that additional points of privileged access to Reddit’s systems are more secure (e.g., enhanced logging, more encryption and requiring token-based 2FA to gain entry since we suspect weaknesses inherent to SMS-based 2FA to be the root cause of this incident.)
What can you do?
First, check whether your data was included in either of the categories called out above by following the instructions there.
If your account credentials were affected and there’s a chance the credentials relate to the password you’re currently using on Reddit, we’ll make you reset your Reddit account password. Whether or not Reddit prompts you to change your password, think about whether you still use the password you used on Reddit 11 years ago on any other sites today.
If your email address was affected, think about whether there’s anything on your Reddit account that you wouldn’t want associated back to that address. You can find instructions on how to remove information from your account on this
help page
.
And, as in all things, a strong unique password and
enabling 2FA
(which we only provide via an authenticator app, not SMS) is recommended for all users, and be alert for potential phishing or scams.",

We’ve been testing Polls with a dozen communities over the past couple months, and have gotten a lot of great feedback. We are excited to now release this post type to everyone!
Why Polls?
It can sometimes be tough for new redditors and lurkers to know where to start on Reddit, , and to feel a sense of community. We believe a simple post type that reduces the posting barrier will make it easier than ever for everyone to contribute to their favorite communities and engage in different ways.
Here’s a look at some of our recent test polls

New Reddit (web): Supports poll creation and voting
Old Reddit (web): Does not support creation. At the bottom of a poll, redditors will see a link to view the poll. Clicking the link will open a new tab where they can view results and vote in the poll

a lot of rules
in our vote tallying as a way to mitigate cheating and brigading on posts and comments.
Here's a rough schematic of what the code looks like without revealing any trade secrets or compromising the integrity of the algorithm.
Many of these rules are still quite useful, but there are a few whose primary impact has been
to sometimes artificially deflate scores on the site
.
Unfortunately, determining the impact of all of these rules is difficult without doing a drastic recompute of all the vote scores historically… so we did that!  Over the past few months, we have carefully recomputed historical votes on posts and comments to remove outdated, unnecessary rules.
Very soon (think hours, not days), we’re going to cut the scores over to be reflective of these new and updated tallies.  A side effect of this is many of our seldom-recomputed listings (e.g., pretty much anything ending in /top) are going to initially display improper sorts. Please don’t panic. Those listings are computed via regular (scheduled) jobs, and as a result those pages will gradually come to reflect the new scoring over the course of the next four to six days.  We expect there to be some shifting of the top/all time queues.  New items will be added in the proper place in the listing, and old items will get reshuffled as the recomputes come in.
To support the larger numbers that will result from this change, we’ll be updating the score display to switch to “k” when the score is over 10,000. Hopefully, this will not require you to further edit your subreddit CSS.
TL;DR
voting is confusing, we cleaned up some outdated rules on voting, and we’re updating the vote scores to be reflective of what they actually are. Scores are increasing by a lot.
Edit
: The scores just updated.  Everyone should now see ""k""s.  Remember: it's going to take about a week for top listings to recompute to reflect the change.

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8qfw8l/protecting_the_free_and_open_internet_european/,56031,2749,Protecting the Free and Open Internet: European Edition,"Hey Reddit,
We care deeply about protecting the free and open internet, and we know Redditors do too. Specifically, we’ve communicated a lot with you in the past year about the Net Neutrality fight in the United States, and ways you can help. One of the most frequent questions that comes up in these conversations is from our European users, asking what they can do to play their part in the fight. Well Europe, now’s your chance. Later this month, the European Parliament’s Legal Affairs Committee will
vote on changes
to copyright law that would put untenable restrictions on how users share news and information with each other. The new Copyright Directive has two big problems:
Article 11
would create a ""link tax:” Links that share short snippets of news articles, even just the headline, could become subject to copyright licensing fees— pretty much ending the way users share and discuss news and information in a place like Reddit.
Article 13
would force internet platforms to install automatic upload filters to scan (and potentially censor) every single piece of content for potential copyright-infringing material. This law does not anticipate the difficult practical questions of how companies can know what is an infringement of copyright.  As a result of this big flaw, the law’s most likely result would be the effective shutdown of user-generated content platforms in Europe, since unless companies know what is infringing, we would need to review and remove all sorts of potentially legitimate content if we believe the company may have liability.
The unmistakable impact of both these measures would be an incredible chilling impact over free expression and the sharing of information online, particularly for users in Europe.
Luckily, there are people and organizations in the EU that are fighting against these scary efforts, and they have organized a day of action today, June 12, to raise the alarm.
Julia Reda, a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) who opposes the measure, joined us last week for
an AMA on the subject
. In it, she offers a number of practical ways that Europeans who care about this issue can get involved. Most importantly, call your MEP and let them know this is important to you!
As a part of their Save the Link campaign, our friends at Open Media have created an
easy tool
to help you identify and call your MEP.
Here are some things you’ll want to mention on the phone with your MEP’s office:
Share your name, location and occupation.
Tell them you oppose Article 11 (the proposal to charge a licensing fee for links) and Article 13 (the proposal to make websites build upload filters to censor content).
Share why these issues impact you. Has your content ever been taken down because of erroneous copyright complaints? Have you learned something new because of a link that someone shared?
Even if you reach an answering machine, leave a message—your concern will still be registered.
Be polite and SAY THANKS! Remember the human.
Phone not your thing? Tweet at your MEP! Anything we can do to get the message across that internet users care about this is important. The vote is expected June 20 or 21, so there is still plenty of time to make our voices heard, but we need to raise them!
And be sure to let us know how it went! Share stories about what your MEP told you in the comments below.
PS If you’re an American and don’t want to miss out on the fun, there is still plenty to do on our side of the pond to save the free and open internet. On June 11, the net neutrality rollback
officially went into effect
, but the effort to reverse it in Congress is still going strong in the House of Representatives.

We’re constantly in awe of what redditors can accomplish when they join forces, from raising money
for children’s hospitals
to shutting down the “inevitable” SOPA/PIPA. Today, European redditors, along with other concerned EU netizens, helped do the impossible once more. Thanks to the ruckus they raised with their Members of the European Parliament,
the flawed EU Copyright Directive has been sent back to the drawing board
, ending (for now) the threats to subject all user uploads to automated content filtering, and require licensing fees for all links.
There is no mistake that it was people power that made this happen. Before the vote, MEP Catherine Stihler of Scotland
noted
that she had received a petition signed by a million people against the changes. Other MEPs noted the deluge of calls and letters that they had received leading up to the vote.
This outpouring of activism about what most people would have considered a dull procedural vote would not have been possible without the awareness and urgency (and, yes,
super-dank memes
) that members of the Reddit community raised, and we’d like to particularly congratulate
r/Europe
for leading the way. They hosted informative AMAs with
MEP Julia Reda
and Europe’s leading
independent experts on copyright reform
, they kept everyone up to date on vote progress and outcomes (check out
their tally of the July 5th vote
to see how your MEP voted), and they
used megathreads
to keep us all in the loop about what was happening and how to help.
What’s Next?
This isn’t over yet. The really important thing about this vote is that it takes what would have been pushed through into law behind closed doors and opens it up to a more public debate process, where citizens have the ability to weigh in, share their views, and build a compromise that protects rightsholders without imperiling free expression.
The next vote will likely be on 10 September, and the coming weeks are critical to ensuring that the MEPs charged with hammering out amendments and drafting that compromise hear from their constituents.

I fucked up. I ruined Thanksgiving. I’m sorry. I won’t do it again. We are taking a more aggressive stance against toxic users and poorly behaving communities. You can filter
r/all
now.
Hi All,
I am sorry: I am sorry for compromising the trust you all have in Reddit, and I am sorry to those that I created work and stress for, particularly over the holidays. It is heartbreaking to think that my actions distracted people from their family over the holiday; instigated harassment of our moderators; and may have harmed Reddit itself, which I love more than just about anything.
The United States is more divided than ever, and we see that tension within Reddit itself. The community that was formed in support of President-elect Donald Trump organized and grew rapidly, but within it were users that devoted themselves to antagonising the broader Reddit community.
Many of you are aware of my attempt to
troll the trolls
last week. I honestly thought I might find some common ground with that community by meeting them on their level. It did not go as planned. I restored the original comments after less than an hour, and
explained what I did
.
I spent my formative years as a young troll on the Internet. I also led the team that built Reddit ten years ago, and spent years moderating the original Reddit communities, so I am as comfortable online as anyone. As CEO, I am often out in the world speaking about how Reddit is the home to conversation online, and a follow on question about harassment on our site is always asked. We have dedicated many of our resources to fighting harassment on Reddit, which is why letting one of our most engaged communities openly harass me felt hypocritical.
While many users across the site found what I did funny, or appreciated that I was standing up to the bullies (I received plenty of support from users of
r/the_donald
), many others did not. I understand what I did has greater implications than my relationship with one community, and it is fair to raise the question of whether this erodes trust in Reddit. I hope our transparency around this event is an indication that we take matters of trust seriously. Reddit is no longer the little website my college roommate,
u/kn0thing
, and I started more than eleven years ago. It is a massive collection of communities that provides news, entertainment, and fulfillment for millions of people around the world, and I am continually humbled by what Reddit has grown into. I will never risk your trust like this again, and we are updating our internal controls to prevent this sort of thing from happening in the future.
More than anything, I want Reddit to heal, and I want our country to heal, and although many of you have asked us to ban the
r/the_donald
outright, it is with this spirit of healing that I have resisted doing so. If there is anything about this election that we have learned, it is that there are communities that feel alienated and just want to be heard, and Reddit has always been a place where those voices can be heard.
However, when we separate the behavior of some of
r/the_donald
users from their politics, it is their behavior we cannot tolerate. The opening statement of our
Content Policy
asks that we all show enough respect to others so that we all may continue to enjoy Reddit for what it is. It is my first duty to do what is best for Reddit, and the current situation is not sustainable.
Historically, we have relied on our relationship with moderators to curb bad behaviors. While some of the moderators have been helpful, this has not been wholly effective, and we are now taking a more proactive approach to policing behavior that is detrimental to Reddit:
We have identified hundreds of the most toxic users and are taking action against them, ranging from warnings to timeouts to permanent bans.
Posts stickied on
r/the_donald
will no longer appear in
r/all
.
r/all
is not our frontpage, but is a popular listing that our most engaged users frequent, including myself. The sticky feature was designed for moderators to make announcements or highlight specific posts. It was not meant to circumvent organic voting, which
r/the_donald
does to slingshot posts into
r/all
, often in a manner that is antagonistic to the rest of the community.
We will continue taking on the most troublesome users, and going forward, if we do not see the situation improve, we will continue to take privileges from communities whose users continually cross the line—up to an outright ban.
Again, I am sorry for the trouble I have caused. While I intended no harm, that was not the result, and I hope these changes improve your experience on Reddit.
Steve

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/,40926,40659,"Upcoming changes to our content policy, our board, and where we’re going from here","TL;DR: We’re working with mods to change our content policy to explicitly address hate.
u/kn0thing
has resigned from our board to fill his seat with a Black candidate, a request we will honor. I want to take responsibility for the history of our policies over the years that got us here, and we still have work to do.
After watching people across the country mourn and demand an end to centuries of murder and violent discrimination against Black people, I wanted to speak out. I wanted to do this both as a human being, who sees this grief and pain and knows I have been spared from it myself because of the color of my skin, and as someone who literally has a platform and, with it, a duty to speak out.
Earlier this week, I wrote an email to our company addressing this crisis and a few ways Reddit will respond. When we shared it, many of the responses said something like, “How can a company that has faced racism from users on its own platform over the years credibly take such a position?”
These questions, which I know are coming from a place of real pain and which I take to heart, are really a statement: There is an unacceptable gap between our beliefs as people and a company, and what you see in our content policy.
Over the last fifteen years, hundreds of millions of people have come to Reddit for things that I believe are fundamentally good: user-driven communities—across a wider spectrum of interests and passions than I could’ve imagined when we first created subreddits—and the kinds of content and conversations that keep people coming back day after day. It's why we come to Reddit as users, as mods, and as employees who want to bring this sort of community and belonging to the world and make it better daily.
However, as Reddit has grown, alongside much good, it is facing its own challenges around hate and racism. We have to acknowledge and accept responsibility for the role we have played. Here are three problems we are most focused on:
Parts of Reddit reflect an unflattering but real resemblance to the world in the hate that Black users and communities see daily, despite the progress we have made in improving our tooling and enforcement.
Users and moderators genuinely do not have enough clarity as to where we as administrators stand on racism.
Our moderators are frustrated and need a real seat at the table to help shape the policies that they help us enforce.
We are already working to fix these problems, and this is a promise for more urgency. Our current
content policy
is effectively nine rules for what you cannot do on Reddit. In many respects, it’s served us well. Under it, we have made meaningful progress cleaning up the platform (and done so without undermining the free expression and authenticity that fuels Reddit). That said, we still have work to do. This current policy lists only what you cannot do, articulates none of the values behind the rules, and does not explicitly take a stance on hate or racism.
We will update our content policy to include a vision for Reddit and its communities to aspire to, a statement on hate, the context for the rules, and a principle that Reddit isn’t to be used as a weapon. We have details to work through, and while we will move quickly, I do want to be thoughtful and also gather feedback from our moderators (through our Mod Councils). With more moderator engagement, the timeline is weeks, not months.
And just this morning, Alexis Ohanian (
u/kn0thing
), my Reddit cofounder, announced that he is resigning from our board and that he wishes for his seat to be filled with a Black candidate, a request that the board and I will honor. We thank Alexis for this meaningful gesture and all that he’s done for us over the years.
At the risk of making this unreadably long, I'd like to take this moment to share how we got here in the first place, where we have made progress, and where, despite our best intentions, we have fallen short.
In the early days of Reddit, 2005–2006, our idealistic “policy” was that, excluding spam, we would not remove content. We were small and did not face many hard decisions. When this ideal was tested, we
banned racist users
anyway. In the end, we acted based on our beliefs, despite our “policy.”
I left Reddit from 2010–2015. During this time, in addition to rapid user growth, Reddit’s no-removal policy
ossified
and its content policy took
no position on hate
.
When I returned in 2015, my top priority was creating a content policy to do two things: deal with hateful communities I had been immediately confronted with (like
r/CoonTown
, which was explicitly designed to spread racist hate) and provide a clear policy of what’s acceptable on Reddit and what’s not.
We banned that community and others
because they were “making Reddit worse” but were not clear and direct about their role in sowing hate. We crafted our
2015 policy
around behaviors adjacent to hate that were actionable and objective: violence and harassment, because we struggled to create a definition of hate and racism that we could defend and enforce at our scale. Through continual updates to these policies
2017
,
2018
,
2019
,
2020
(and a broader definition of violence), we have removed thousands of hateful communities.
While we dealt with many communities themselves, we still did not provide the clarity—and it showed, both in our enforcement and in confusion about where we stand. In 2018, I confusingly said
racism is not against the rules, but also isn’t welcome on Reddit
. This gap between our content policy and our values has eroded our effectiveness in combating hate and racism on Reddit; I accept full responsibility for this.
This inconsistency has hurt our trust with our users and moderators and has made us slow to respond to problems. This was also true with
r/the_donald
, a community that relished in exploiting and detracting from the best of Reddit and that is now nearly disintegrated on their own accord. As we looked to our policies, “Breaking Reddit” was not a sufficient explanation for actioning a political subreddit, and I fear we let being technically correct get in the way of doing the right thing. Clearly, we should have quarantined it sooner.
The majority of our top communities have a rule banning hate and racism, which makes us proud, and is evidence why a
community-led approach is the only way to scale moderation online
. That said, this is not a rule communities should have to write for themselves and we need to rebalance the burden of enforcement. I also accept responsibility for this.
Despite making significant progress over the years, we have to turn a mirror on ourselves and be willing to do the hard work of making sure we are living up to our values in our product and policies. This is a significant moment. We have a choice: return to the status quo or use this opportunity for change. We at Reddit are opting for the latter, and we will do our very best to be a part of the progress.
I will be sticking around for a while to answer questions as usual, but I also know that our policies and actions will speak louder than our comments.
Thanks,
Steve",

Transparency Report
. I’ll stick around to answer your questions about the report (and other topics) in the comments.
Hi all,
It’s that time of year again when we share Reddit’s annual transparency report.
We share this report each year because you have a right to know how user data is being managed by Reddit, and how it’s both shared and not shared with government and non-government parties.
You’ll find information on content removed from Reddit and requests for user information. This year, we’ve expanded the report to include new data—specifically, a breakdown of content policy removals, content manipulation removals, subreddit removals, and subreddit quarantines.
By the numbers
Since the
full report
is rather long, I’ll call out a few stats below:
ADMIN REMOVALS
In 2019, we removed
~53M
pieces of content in total, mostly for spam and content manipulation (e.g. brigading and vote cheating), exclusive of legal/copyright removals, which we track separately.
For
Content Policy
violations, we removed
222k
pieces of content
,
55.9k accounts
, and
21.9k
subreddits
(
87%
of which were removed for being unmoderated).
Additionally, we quarantined
256 subreddits
.
LEGAL REMOVALS
Reddit received
110 requests
from government entities to remove content, of which we complied with
37.3%
.
In 2019 we removed about
5x more
content for copyright infringement than in 2018, largely due to copyright notices for adult-entertainment and notices targeting pieces of content that had already been removed.
REQUESTS FOR USER INFORMATION
We received a total of
772 requests
for user account information from law enforcement and government entities.
366
of these were emergency disclosure requests, mostly from US law enforcement (
68%
of which we complied with).
406
were non-emergency requests (
73%
of which we complied with); most were US subpoenas.
Reddit received an additional
224 requests
to temporarily preserve certain user account information (
86%
of which we complied with).
Note: We carefully review each request for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If we determine that a request is not legally valid, Reddit will challenge or reject it. (You can read more in our
Privacy Policy
and
Guidelines for Law Enforcement
.)
While I have your attention...
I’d like to share an update about our thinking around quarantined communities.
When we
expanded our quarantine policy
, we created an appeals process for sanctioned communities. One of the goals was to “force subscribers to reconsider their behavior and incentivize moderators to make changes.” While the policy attempted to hold moderators more accountable for enforcing healthier rules and norms, it didn’t address the role that each member plays in the health of their community.
Today, we’re making an update to address this gap: Users who consistently upvote policy-breaking content within quarantined communities will receive automated warnings, followed by further consequences like a temporary or permanent suspension. We hope this will encourage healthier behavior across these communities.

It’s Election Day here in the US, and we want to help make sure that all registered voters get to the polls and make their voices heard. We’ve compiled some resources here to help you cast your ballot.
Where do I vote?
Your polling place is based on the address at which you registered. Polling places can be looked up through your state’s elections office (
find yours here
). These state websites are the most complete resources for all your voting needs.
There are also numerous quick lookup tools to find your polling place, voting hours, and even information about what’s on the ballot in your area.
The Voting Information Tool
is one of the easiest to use.
Do I need to already be registered to vote? And how can I see if I’m registered?
It depends on your state. Some states allow for same-day registration, so
you may still be able to vote even if you haven’t registered
. You can
check your state’s registration requirements here
. In most cases you’ll also be able to check your registration status on the same page.
What do I need to bring with me?
Some states require you to bring identification with you to the polls and some states don’t. You can see what your state’s requirements are
here
.
If your state requires identification and you don’t have it, you may still be able to vote, so still go to the polls.
Depending on your local laws, you may be able to cast a provisional ballot, show ID later, sign a form attesting your identity, or another method. Don’t assume that you can’t vote!
What am I going to be voting on?
Some people are surprised to find out when they get to the polls the sheer number of offices and issues they may be voting on. Don’t be caught unprepared! You can
look up a sample ballot for your area
to find out what you’ll be voting on, so that you’re informed when you head into the voting booth. You can even print out your sample ballot and take it to the poll with you so you can keep track of how you want to vote.
I have a disability or language barrier. Can I still vote?
Yes! There are federal laws in place to ensure that all eligible Americans can vote. You can
learn more about your rights and the accommodations you are entitled to here.
Someone is trying to prevent me from voting or is deliberately spreading disinformation about voting. What should I do?
Intimidating voters, trying to influence votes through threats or coercion, or attempting to suppress voters, including through misinformation campaigns, is against the law. If you witness such behavior, report it to your local election officials (
look up their contact info here
).
If you see suspected voter suppression attempts on Reddit (eg efforts to deliberately misinform people about voting so that they won’t vote, or so that their vote might not count),
report it to the admins here
.
I have more questions about voting!

Are You Registered?,"Voting is embedded in the Reddit experience. Yet offline, 1 in 4 eligible US voters isn’t registered. Even the most civically-conscious among us can unexpectedly find our registration lapsed, especially due to the wide variation in voter registration laws across the US. For example, did you know that you have to update your voter registration if you move, even if it’s just across town? Or that you also need to update it if you’ve changed your name (say, due to a change in marital status)? Depending on your state, you may even need to re-register if you simply haven’t voted in a while, even if you’ve stayed at the same address.
Taken together, these and other factors add up to tens of millions of Americans every election cycle who need to update their registration and might not know it. This is why we are again teaming up with
Nonprofit VOTE
to celebrate
National Voter Registration Day
and help spread the word before the midterms this November.
You’ll notice a lot of activity around the site today in honor of the holiday, including amongst various communities that have decided to participate. If you see a particularly cool community effort, let us know in the comments.
We’d also love to hear your personal stories about voting. Why is it important to you? What was your experience like the first time you voted? Are you registering to vote for the first time for this election? Join the conversation in the comments.
Also check out the AMAs we have planned for today as well, including:
A bipartisan tag-team AMA with the Secretaries of State of Washington and Minnesota
in
r/politics
from 10am-12pm ET
An AMA about the weird quirks and history of American voting laws
with DoSomething.org’s Head of Campaigns in
r/IAmA
at 11am ET.
You can also see the
AMA that National Voter Registration Day’s Executive Director
did yesterday.
Finally, be sure to take this occasion to
make sure that you are registered to vote
where you live, or update your registration as necessary. Don’t be left out on Election Day!

We have been hard at work the past few months adding features, improving our ads business, and protecting users. Here is some of the stuff we have been up to:
Hopefully you did not notice, but as of last week, the m.reddit.com is powered by an entirely new tech platform. We call it 2X. In addition to load times being significantly faster for users (by about 2x…) development is also much quicker. This means faster iteration and more improvements going forward. Our recently released
AMP site
and moderator mail are already running on 2X.
Speaking of modmail, the beta we
announced
a couple months ago is going well. Thirty communities volunteered to help us iron out the kinks (thank you,
r/DIY
!). The community
feedback
has been invaluable, and we are incorporating as much as we can in preparation for the general release, which we expect to be sometime next month.
Prepare your pitchforks: we are enabling basic interest targeting in our advertising product. This will allow advertisers to target audiences based on a handful of predefined interests (e.g. sports, gaming, music, etc.), which will be informed by which communities they frequent. A targeted ad is more relevant to users and more valuable to advertisers. We describe this functionality in our
privacy policy
and have added a permanent link to this
opt-out page
. The main changes are in 'Advertising and Analytics’. The opt-out is per-browser, so it should work for both logged in and logged out users.
We have a cool community feature in the works as well. Improved
spoiler tags
went into beta earlier today. Communities have long been using tricks with NSFW tags to hide spoilers, which is clever, but also results in side-effects like actual NSFW content everywhere just because you want to discuss the latest episode of The Walking Dead.
We did have some fun with Atlantic Recording Corporation in the last couple of months.  After a user posted a link to a leaked Twenty One Pilots song from the Suicide Squad soundtrack, Atlantic petitioned a NY court to order us to turn over all information related to the user and any users with the same IP address. We pushed back on the request, and our lawyer, who knows how to turn a phrase, opposed the petition by arguing, ""Because Atlantic seeks to use pre-action discovery as an impermissible fishing expedition to determine if it has a plausible claim for breach of contract or breach of fiduciary duty against the Reddit user and not as a means to match an existing, meritorious claim to an individual, its petition for pre-action discovery should be denied."" After seeing our opposition and arguing its case in front of a NY judge, Atlantic withdrew its petition entirely, signaling our victory. While pushing back on these requests requires time and money on our end, we believe it is important for us to ensure applicable legal standards are met before we disclose user information.
Lastly, we are celebrating the kick-off of our eighth annual Secret Santa exchange next Tuesday on Reddit Gifts! It is true Reddit tradition, often filled with great gifts and surprises. If you have never participated, now is the perfect time to
create an account
. It will be a fantastic event this year.
I will be hanging around to answer questions about this or anything else for the next hour or so.

The filter bots...they're back
UPDATE 9/12/18:
Unfortunately
the vote didn't go our way
, with both Articles 11 and 13 passing. We're going to have to assess what this means for Reddit, and determine what next steps might be. While this isn't the result that we hoped for, I'd still like to thank all the redditors who contacted their MEPs about this. We'll keep you updated about what comes next. For those interested in the details of how individual party blocks and MEPs voted, Julia Reda has

​
Hey Everyone!
(And a very special
bonjour, hola, hallo, ciao, hej, sveiki, ahoj, buna,
and the rest to our European redditors in particular.)
It’s September, which means Europe’s back from vacation and we have an update for you on the EU copyright saga and its implications for the open Internet.
When we last left you
on July 5 (aka
Meme Day
), a truly disastrous version of the EU Copyright Directive was defeated, thanks primarily to the outpouring of concern from netizens rightfully worried about its implications for free expression. You’ll remember that because of the way the draft eliminated copyright liability protections for platforms, the proposed law would have radically changed how sites like Reddit work. It would have forced us to either cut off usage in Europe or install
error-prone copyright filters
on your posts, resulting in a machine-censored user experience and striking a huge blow to the concept of the open Internet.
The July 5th “no” vote kicked the draft Directive back to the drawing board, and now a flurry of amendments have surfaced. Some are good, but some are just as bad as the original. For anyone who is interested in the nitty-gritty of the amendments,
MEP Julia Reda
has a
pretty good rundown of them here
(note, this issue is fast-moving and amendments are changing daily).
The bottom line is most of the amendments, short of the proposal to delete Article 13 all together, don’t make an appreciable difference from the last draft in terms of how they would force us to filter your posts (our friends at EDRi
break down why that is here
).
The good news is, this measure—including whatever amendments are adopted—will go to a vote of the FULL European Parliament on September 12. This means that Every. Single. MEP. will have to vote on the record on this issue, and be accountable for that vote come election time. That’s why we’re participating in
A©tion Week
to spread the work and help people contact their MEPs. If you live in Europe, you can let your MEP know that this is an issue that you care about, and urge them to reject Article 13. The good folks at
SaveYourInternet.eu
have put together a wealth of resources for you to see how your country voted on July 5, look up your MEP, and share your views with them.
Check it out, and after you’ve called, let us know in the comments what your MEP office said!

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/827zqc/in_response_to_recent_reports_about_the_integrity/,31117,21707,"In response to recent reports about the integrity of Reddit, I’d like to share our thinking.","In the past couple of weeks, Reddit has been mentioned as one of the platforms used to promote Russian propaganda. As it’s an ongoing investigation, we have been relatively quiet on the topic publicly, which I know can be frustrating. While transparency is important, we also want to be careful to not tip our hand too much while we are investigating. We take the integrity of Reddit extremely seriously, both as the stewards of the site and as Americans.
Given the recent news, we’d like to share some of what we’ve learned:
When it comes to Russian influence on Reddit, there are three broad areas to discuss: ads, direct propaganda from Russians, indirect propaganda promoted by our users.
On the first topic, ads, there is not much to share. We don’t see a lot of ads from Russia, either before or after the 2016 election, and what we do see are mostly ads promoting spam and ICOs.  Presently, ads from Russia are blocked entirely, and all ads on Reddit are reviewed by humans. Moreover, our
ad policies
prohibit content that depicts intolerant or overly contentious political or cultural views.
As for direct propaganda, that is, content from accounts we suspect are of Russian origin or content linking directly to known propaganda domains, we are doing our best to identify and remove it. We have found and removed a few hundred accounts, and of course, every account we find expands our search a little more. The vast majority of suspicious accounts we have found in the past months were banned back in 2015–2016 through our enhanced efforts to prevent abuse of the site generally.
The final case, indirect propaganda, is the most complex. For example, the Twitter account @TEN_GOP is now known to be a Russian agent. @TEN_GOP’s Tweets were amplified by thousands of Reddit users, and sadly, from everything we can tell, these users are mostly American, and appear to be unwittingly promoting Russian propaganda. I believe the biggest risk we face as Americans is our own ability to discern reality from nonsense, and this is a burden we all bear.
I wish there was a solution as simple as banning all propaganda, but it’s not that easy. Between truth and fiction are a thousand shades of grey. It’s up to all of us—Redditors, citizens, journalists—to work through these issues. It’s somewhat ironic, but I actually believe what we’re going through right now will actually reinvigorate Americans to be more vigilant, hold ourselves to higher standards of discourse, and fight back against propaganda, whether foreign or not.
Thank you for reading. While I know it’s frustrating that we don’t share everything we know publicly, I want to reiterate that we take these matters very seriously, and we are cooperating with congressional inquiries. We are growing more sophisticated by the day, and we remain open to suggestions and feedback for how we can improve.",

Reddit-hosted video and gifs
;
crossposting
is in beta; and Reddit’s web redesign is in alpha testing with a limited number of users, which we’ll be expanding to an opt-in beta later this month.

In real life, we finished our moderator thank you tour where we met with hundreds of moderators all over the US. It was great getting to know many of you, and we received a ton of good feedback and product ideas that will be working their way into production soon. The next major release of the native apps
should
make moderators happy (but you never know how these things will go…).
Last week we expanded our content policy to clarify our stance around violent content. The previous policy forbade “inciting violence,” but we found it lacking, so we expanded the policy to cover any content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against people or animals. We don’t take changes to our policies lightly, but we felt this one was necessary to continue to make Reddit a place where people feel welcome.

We just posted our
2016 Transparency Report
. It details government and law-enforcement-agency requests for private information about our users. We publish it each year, and you can find previous versions
here
.
Our goals in publishing the report are to demonstrate Reddit’s commitment to remaining a place that encourages authentic conversation and to share with you the ways in which we work to protect the privacy of our users.
Generally, the types of requests we receive are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. We require all requests to be legally valid, and, in 2016, we did not produce records in response to approximately 40% of them, which is on par with previous years.
Another way in which we stand up on behalf of users is through participation in
amicus briefs
. Basically, we say we support a party and their position. In tech, it is one of the few areas in which many companies work together to send a strong message to courts.
We participated in a couple amicus briefs this year, including one on
behalf of Facebook
in the state of New York, who was served with a bulk warrant for account information, photos, private messages, and other information for 381 individuals. Reddit joined with a number of other tech companies in supporting Facebook’s arguments that questioned the legal validity of the bulk search warrant and the associated gag order which prevented Facebook from notifying its users.
Again, in support of Facebook, we joined a group to fight against a Section 230 ruling in the state of California. Section 230 essentially allows platforms like Reddit to exist because it grants broad immunity to online service providers from harms arising out of third-party content. In this case, the trial court had held that Jason Cross a/k/a Michael Knight (“Knight”) could seek to hold Facebook liable for failing to remove third-party content that Knight found objectionable.  Amici
filed a response
in support of Facebook and to argue against the trial court’s order finding that California right of publicity claims fall outside the broad scope of Section 230’s immunity.
Thank you for reading. I hope that you take this report as a sign of our commitment to your privacy and trust.
I’ll answer any questions that I can, but please understand I can’t always be completely candid when it comes to legal matters.

Back in the day, the original version of the front page looked an awful lot like
r/all
.  In fact, it
was
r/all
.  But, when we first released the ability for users to
create subreddits
, those new, nascent communities had trouble competing with the larger, more established subreddits which dominated the top of the front page.  To mitigate this effect, we created the notion of the defaults, in which we
cherry picked
a set of subreddits to appear as a default set, which had the effect of editorializing Reddit.
Over the years, Reddit has grown up, with hundreds of millions of users and tens of thousands of active communities, each with enormous reach and great content. Consequently, the “defaults” have received a disproportionate amount of traffic, and made it difficult for new users to see the rest of Reddit. We, therefore, are trying to make the Reddit experience more inclusive by launching
r/popular
, which, like
r/all
, opens the door to allowing more communities to climb to the front page.
Logged out users will land on “popular” by default and see a large source of diverse content.
Existing logged in users will still maintain their subscriptions.
How are posts eligible to show up “popular”?
First, a post must have enough votes to show up on the front page in the first place. 
Post from the following types of communities will not show up on “popular”:
NSFW and 18+ communities
Communities that have opted out of
r/all
A handful of subreddits that users
consistently filter
out of their
r/all
page
What will this change for logged in users?
Nothing! Your frontpage is still made up of your subscriptions, and you can still access
r/all
. If you sign up today, you will still see the 50 defaults. We are working on making that transition experience smoother. If you are interested in checking out
r/popular
, you can do so by clicking on the link on the gray nav bar the top of your page, right between “FRONT” and “ALL”.
TL;DR:
We’ve created a new page called “popular” that will be the default experience for logged out users, to provide those users with better, more diverse content.

TL;DR People creating new accounts won't be subscribed to 50 default subreddits, and we're adding subscribe buttons to Popular.
Many years ago, we realized that it was difficult for new redditors to discover the rich content that existed on the site. At the time, our best option was to select a set of communities to feature for all new users, which we called (creatively), “the defaults”.
Over the past few years we have seen a wealth of diverse and healthy communities grow across Reddit. The default communities have done a great job as the first face of Reddit, but at our size, we can showcase many more amazing communities and conversations. We recently launched
r/popular
as a start to improving the community discovery experience, with extremely positive results.

On Thursday, August 11, Reddit was down and unreachable across all platforms for about 1.5 hours, and slow to respond for an additional 1.5 hours. We apologize for the downtime and want to let you know steps we are taking to prevent it from happening again.
Thank you all for contributions to
r/downtimebananas
.
Impact
On Aug 11, Reddit was down from 15:24PDT to 16:52PDT, and was degraded from 16:52PDT to 18:19PDT. This affected all official Reddit platforms and the API serving third party applications. The downtime was due to an error during a migration of a critical backend system.
No data was lost.
Cause and Remedy
We use a system called Zookeeper to keep track of most of our servers and their health. We also use an autoscaler system to maintain the required number of servers based on system load.
Part of our infrastructure upgrades included migrating Zookeeper to a new, more modern, infrastructure inside the Amazon cloud. Since autoscaler reads from Zookeeper, we shut it off manually during the migration so it wouldn’t get confused about which servers should be available. It unexpectedly turned back on at 15:23PDT because our package management system noticed a manual change and reverted it. Autoscaler read the partially migrated Zookeeper data and terminated many of our application servers, which serve our website and API, and our caching servers, in 16 seconds.
At 15:24PDT, we noticed servers being shut down, and at 15:47PDT, we set the site to “down mode” while we restored the servers. By 16:42PDT, all servers were restored. However, at that point our new caches were still empty, leading to increased load on our databases, which in turn led to degraded performance. By 18:19PDT, latency returned to normal, and all systems were operating normally.
Prevention
As we modernize our infrastructure, we may continue to perform different types of server migrations. Since this was due to a unique and risky migration that is now complete, we don’t expect this exact combination of failures to occur again. However, we have identified several improvements that will increase our overall tolerance to mistakes that can occur during risky migrations.
Make our autoscaler less aggressive by putting limits to how many servers can be shut down at once.
Improve our migration process by having two engineers pair during risky parts of migrations.
Properly disable package management systems during migrations so they don’t affect systems unexpectedly.
Last Thoughts
We take downtime seriously, and are sorry for any inconvenience that we caused. The silver lining is that in the process of restoring our systems, we completed a big milestone in our operations modernization that will help make development a lot faster and easier at Reddit.",

Reddit is a great place to discuss the things you love.  And right now the culture industry is working overtime to pump out oodles of the things you love.  Whatever these passions, you can find a community on Reddit that is as excited about them as you are.  That could be:

OP can now mark their post as a spoiler — this will add a tag to the post that clearly identifies it containing spoilers and pixilate the preview image if there is one.  Other users can then decide whether or not they want to view the post.

Today we’ve posted our latest
Transparency Report
.
The purpose of the report is to share information about the requests Reddit receives to disclose user data or remove content from the site. We value your privacy and believe you have a right to know how data is being managed by Reddit and how it is shared (and not shared) with governmental and non-governmental parties.
We’ve included a breakdown of requests from governmental entities worldwide and from private parties from within the United States. The most common types of requests are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. In 2018, Reddit received a total of 581 requests to produce user account information from both United States and foreign governmental entities, which represents a 151% increase from the year before. We scrutinize all requests and object when appropriate, and we didn’t disclose any information for 23% of the requests. We received 28 requests from foreign government authorities for the production of user account information and did not comply with any of those requests.
This year, we expanded the report to included details on two additional types of content removals: those taken by us at Reddit, Inc., and those taken by subreddit moderators (including Automod actions). We remove content that is in violation of our site-wide policies, but subreddits often have additional rules specific to the
purpose, tone, and norms of their community
. You can now see the breakdown of these two types of takedowns for a more holistic view of company and community actions.
In other news, you may have heard that we closed an additional round of funding this week, which gives us more runway and will help us continue to improve our platform. What else does this mean for you? Not much. Our strategy and governance model remain the same. And—of course—we do not share specific user data with any investor, new or old.
I’ll hang around for a while to answer your questions.

But why?
Last week
we announced
our 8th year partnering with Extra Life for our favorite annual tradition: playing
24
25 hours of video games to help raise money for sick kids. We're not doing this alone! Thanks to some truly heroic redditors, we have already raised over $40,000 of our $150,000 goal!
However, we recognize not everyone can relinquish the majority of their weekend to play video games (we totally had other plans, we swear). We made this award to make it easier for even more people to get involved and help support one of our favorite charity events.
Have the opposite problem? If your wallet is feeling thin, you can also help by signing up to fundraise! Check out
our recent post
for more details about joining Team Reddit.
Reminder: Extra Life Game Day is November 2nd!
On this coming Saturday a raiding party of staffers here at Reddit HQ will be streaming our fundraising efforts live on our
Twitch stream
. Tune in and join us for 25 hours of mind-melting gaming and delirious, sleep-deprived antics. From Fortnite to Untitled Goose Game, we'll be playing a variety of games, so join us and you may even get to play head-to-head against an admin in your favorite game!",
announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4tmb16/karma_for_textposts_aka_selfposts/,23112,4245,Karma for text-posts (AKA self-posts),"As most of you already know, fictional internet points are probably the most precious resource in the world.  On Reddit we call these points Karma.  You get Karma when content you post to Reddit receives upvotes.  Your Karma is displayed on
your userpage
.
You may also know that you can submit different types of posts to Reddit.  One of these post types is a text-post (e.g. this thing you’re reading right now is a text-post).  Due to
various shenanigans and low effort content
we stopped giving Karma for text-posts over 8 years ago.
However, over time the usage of text-posts has matured and they are now used to create some of the most iconic and interesting original content on Reddit.  Who could forget such classics as:
Jar Jar Binks was a trained Force user, knowing Sith collaborator, and will play a central role in The Force Awakens
- from
r/starwars
What tasty food would be disgusting if eaten over rice?
- from
r/askreddit
You people make me sick [a grilled cheese meltdown]
- from
r/grilledcheese
Text-posts make up over 65% of submissions to Reddit and some of our best subreddits only accept text-posts. Because of this Reddit has become known for thought-provoking, witty, and in-depth text-posts, and their success has played a large role in the popularity Reddit currently enjoys.
To acknowledge this, from this day forward we will now be giving users karma for text-posts. This will be combined with link karma and presented as ‘post karma’ on
userpages
.
TL:DR; We used to not give you karma for your text-posts.  We do now.  Sweet.

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/hi3oht/update_to_our_content_policy/,21319,38345,Update to Our Content Policy,"A few weeks ago
, we committed to closing the gap between our values and our policies to explicitly address hate. After talking extensively with mods, outside organizations, and our own teams, we’re updating our content policy today and enforcing it (with your help).
First, a quick recap
Since our last post, here’s what we’ve been doing:
We brought on a
new Board member
.
We held policy calls with mods
—both from established Mod Councils and from communities disproportionately targeted with hate—and discussed areas where we can do better to action bad actors, clarify our policies, make mods' lives easier, and concretely reduce hate.
You can find
detailed notes from our All-Council mod call here
, including specific product work we discussed.
We developed our enforcement plan
, including both our immediate actions (e.g., today’s bans) and long-term investments (tackling the most critical work discussed in our mod calls, sustainably enforcing the new policies, and advancing Reddit’s community governance).
From our conversations with mods and outside experts, it’s clear that while we’ve gotten better in some areas—like actioning violations at the community level,
scaling enforcement efforts
, measurably reducing hateful experiences like harassment
year over year
—we still have a long way to go to address the gaps in our policies and enforcement to date.
These include addressing questions our policies have left unanswered (like whether hate speech is allowed or even protected on Reddit), aspects of our product and mod tools that are still too easy for individual bad actors to abuse (inboxes, chats, modmail), and areas where we can do better to partner with our mods and communities who want to combat the same hateful conduct we do.
Ultimately, it’s our responsibility to support our communities by taking stronger action against those who try to weaponize parts of Reddit against other people. In the near term, this support will translate into some of the product work we discussed with mods. But it starts with dealing squarely with the hate we can mitigate today through our policies and enforcement.
New Policy
This is the
new content policy
. Here’s what’s different:
It starts with a statement of our vision for Reddit and our communities, including the basic expectations we have for all communities and users.
Rule 1
explicitly states that communities and users that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.
There is an expanded definition of what constitutes a violation of this rule, along with specific examples, in our
Help Center article
.
Rule 2
ties together our previous rules on prohibited behavior with an ask to abide by community rules and post with authentic, personal interest.
Debate and creativity are welcome, but spam and malicious attempts to interfere with other communities are not.
The other rules are the same in spirit but have been rewritten for clarity and inclusiveness.
Alongside the change to the content policy, we are initially banning about 2000 subreddits, the vast majority of which are inactive. Of these communities, about
200
have more than 10 daily users. Both
r/The_Donald
and
r/ChapoTrapHouse
were included.
All communities on Reddit must abide by our content policy in good faith. We banned
r/The_Donald
because it has not done so, despite every opportunity. The community has consistently hosted and upvoted more rule-breaking content than average (Rule 1), antagonized us and other communities (Rules 2 and 8), and its mods have refused to meet our most basic expectations. Until now, we’ve worked in good faith to help them preserve the community as a space for its users—through warnings, mod changes, quarantining, and more.
Though smaller,
r/ChapoTrapHouse
was banned for similar reasons: They consistently host rule-breaking content and their mods have demonstrated no intention of reining in their community.
To be clear, views across the political spectrum are allowed on Reddit—but all communities must work within our policies and do so in good faith, without exception.
Our commitment
Our policies will never be perfect, with new edge cases that inevitably lead us to evolve them in the future. And as users, you will always have more context, community vernacular, and cultural values to inform the standards set within your communities than we as site admins or any AI ever could.
But just as our content moderation cannot scale effectively without your support, you need more support from us as well, and we admit we have fallen short towards this end. We are committed to working with you to combat the bad actors, abusive behaviors, and toxic communities that undermine our mission and get in the way of the creativity, discussions, and communities that bring us all to Reddit in the first place. We hope that our progress towards this commitment, with today’s update and those to come, makes Reddit a place you enjoy and are proud to be a part of for many years to come.

We’ve got some updates to share about Reddit the platform, community, and business:
First off, thank you to all of you who participated in the Net Neutrality Day of Action earlier this month! We believe a free and open Internet is the most important advancement of our lifetime, and its preservation is paramount. Even if the FCC chooses to disregard public opinion and rolls back existing Net Neutrality regulations, the fight for Internet freedom is far from over, and Reddit will be there. Alexis and I just returned from Washington, D.C. where we met with members and senators on both sides of the aisle and shared your
stories
and passion about this issue. Thank you again for
making your voice heard
.
We’re happy to report Reddit IRL is alive and well: while in D.C., we hosted one of a series of meetups around the country to connect with moderators in person, and back in June, Redditors gathered for Global Reddit Meetup Day across 120 cities worldwide. We have a few more meetups planned this year, and so far it’s been great fun to connect with everyone face to face.
Reddit has
closed another round of funding
. This is an important milestone for the company, and while Reddit the business continues to grow and is healthier than ever, the additional capital provides even more resources to build a Reddit that is accessible, welcoming, broad, and available to everyone on the planet. I want to emphasize our values and goals are not changing, and our investors continue to support our mission.
On the product side, we have a lot going on. It’s incredible how much we’re building, and we’re excited to show you over the coming months. Our video beta continues to expand. A few hundred communities have access, and have been critical to working out bugs and polishing the system. We’re creating more
geo-specific
views of Reddit, and the web redesign (codename: Reddit4) is well underway. I can’t wait for you all to see what we’re working on. The redesign is a massive effort and will take months to deploy. We'll have an alpha end of August, a public beta in October, and we'll see where the feedback takes us from there.
We’re making some changes to our
Privacy Policy
. Specifically, we’re phasing out Do Not Track, which isn’t supported by all browsers, doesn’t work on mobile, and is implemented by few—if any—advertisers, and replacing it with our own
privacy controls
. DNT is a nice idea, but without buy-in from the entire ecosystem, its impact is limited. In place of DNT, we're adding in new, more granular privacy controls that give you control over how Reddit uses any data we collect about you. This applies to data we collect both on and off Reddit  (some of which ad blockers don’t catch). The information we collect allows us to serve you both more relevant content and ads. While there is a tension between privacy and personalization, we will continue to be upfront with you about what we collect and give you mechanisms to opt out. Changes go into effect in 30 days.
Our Community, Trust & Safety, and Anti-Evil teams are hitting their stride. For the first time ever, the majority of our enforcement actions last quarter were proactive instead of reactive. This means we’re catching abuse earlier, and as a result we saw over 1M fewer moderator reports despite traffic increasing over the same period (speaking of which, we updated
community traffic
numbers to be more accurate).
While there is plenty more to report, I’ll stop here. If you have any questions about the above or anything else, I’ll be here a couple hours.

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9bvkqa/an_update_on_the_fireeye_report_and_reddit/,21005,5011,An update on the FireEye report and Reddit,"Last week, FireEye
made an announcement
regarding the discovery of a suspected influence operation originating in Iran and linked to a number of suspicious domains. When we learned about this, we began investigating instances of these suspicious domains on Reddit. We also conferred with third parties to learn more about the operation, potential technical markers, and other relevant information. While this investigation is still ongoing, we would like to share our current findings.
To date, we have uncovered 143 accounts we believe to be connected to this influence group. The vast majority (126) were created between 2015 and 2018. A handful (17) dated back to 2011.
This group focused on steering the narrative around subjects important to Iran, including criticism of US policies in the Middle East and negative sentiment toward Saudi Arabia and Israel. They were also involved in discussions regarding Syria and ISIS.
None of these accounts placed any ads on Reddit.
More than a third (51 accounts) were banned prior to the start of this investigation as a result of our routine trust and safety practices, supplemented by user reports (thank you for your help!).
Most (around 60%) of the accounts had karma below 1,000, with 36% having zero or negative karma. However, a minority did garner some traction, with 40% having more than 1,000 karma. Specific karma breakdowns of the accounts are as follows:
3% (4) had negative karma
33% (47) had 0 karma
24% (35) had 1-999 karma
15% (21) had 1,000-9,999 karma
25% (36) had 10,000+ karma
To give you more insight into our findings, we have preserved a sampling of accounts from a range of karma levels that demonstrated behavior typical of the others in this group of 143. We have decided to keep them visible for now, but after a period of time the accounts and their content will be removed from Reddit. We are doing this to allow moderators, investigators, and all of you to see their account histories for yourselves, and to educate the public about tactics that foreign influence attempts may use.  The example accounts include:
u/emilyward2017
u/Homaeefar
u/alessia_80s
u/Anzfp
u/jeremybernard
u/suarezanton
Unlike our
last post on foreign interference
, the behaviors of this group were different.  While the overall influence of these accounts was still low, some of them were able to gain more traction. They typically did this by posting real, reputable news articles that happened to align with Iran’s preferred political narrative -- for example, reports publicizing civilian deaths in Yemen. These articles would often be posted to far-left or far-right political communities whose critical views of US involvement in the Middle East formed an environment that was receptive to the articles.
Through this investigation, the incredible vigilance of the Reddit community has been brought to light, helping us pinpoint some of the suspicious account behavior. However, the volume of user reports we’ve received has highlighted the opportunity to enhance our defenses by developing a trusted reporter system to better separate useful information from the noise, which is something we are working on.
We believe this type of interference will increase in frequency, scope, and complexity. We're investing in more advanced detection and mitigation capabilities, and have recently formed a threat detection team that has a very particular set of skills. Skills they have acquired...you know the drill. Our actions against these threats may not always be immediately visible to you, but this is a battle we have been fighting, and will continue to fight for the foreseeable future. And of course, we’ll continue to communicate openly with you about these subjects.",
announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4oedco/lets_all_have_a_town_hall_about_rall/,20690,10652,Let’s all have a town hall about r/all,"Hi All,
A few days ago, we talked about a few technological and process changes we would be working on in order to improve your Reddit experience and ensure access to timely information is available.
Over the last day we rolled out a behavior change to
r/all
. The
r/all
listing gives us a glimpse into what is happening on all of Reddit independent of specific interests or subscriptions. In many ways,
r/all
is a reflection of what is happening online in general. It is culturally important and drives many conversations around the world.
The changes we are making are to preserve this aspect of
r/all
—our specific goal being to prevent any one community from dominating the listing. The algorithm change is fairly simple—as a community is represented more and more often in the listing, the hotness of its posts will be increasingly lessened. This results in more variety in
r/all
.
Many people will ask if this is related to
r/the_donald
. The short answer is no, we have been working on this change for a while, but I cannot deny their behavior hastened its deployment. We have seen many communities like
r/the_donald
over the years—ones that attempt to dominate the conversation on Reddit at the expense of everyone else. This undermines Reddit, and we are not going to allow it.
Interestingly enough,
r/the_donald
was already getting downvoted out of
r/all
yesterday morning before we made any changes. It seems the rest of the Reddit community had had enough. Ironically,
r/EnoughTrumpSpam
was hit harder than any other community when we rolled out the changes. That’s Reddit for you. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
As always, we will keep an eye out for any unintended side-effects and make changes as necessary. Community has always been one of the very best things about Reddit—let’s remember that. Thank you for reading, thank you for Reddit-ing, let’s all get back to connecting with our fellow humans, sharing ferret gifs, and making the Reddit the most fun, authentic place online.

Now that it’s far enough into the year that we’re all
writing the date correctly
, I thought I’d give a quick recap of 2017 and share some of what we’re working on in 2018.
In 2017, we doubled the size of our staff, and as a result, we accomplished more than ever:
We recently gave our
iOS
and
Android
apps major updates that, in addition to many of your most-requested features, also includes a new suite of mod tools. If you haven’t tried the app in a while, please check it out!
We added a ton of new features to Reddit, from spoiler tags and post-to-profile to chat (now in beta for individuals and groups), and we’re especially pleased to see features that didn’t exist a year ago like crossposts and native video on our front pages every day.
Not every launch has gone swimmingly, and while we may not respond to everything directly, we do see and read all of your feedback. We rarely get things right the first time (profile pages, anybody?), but we’re still working on these features and we’ll do our best to continue improving Reddit for everybody. If you’d like to participate and follow along with every change, subscribe to
r/announcements
(major announcements),
r/beta
(long-running tests),
r/modnews
(moderator features), and
r/changelog
(most everything else).
I’m particularly proud of how far our Community, Trust & Safety, and Anti-Evil teams have come. We’ve steadily shifted the balance of our work from reactive to proactive, which means that much more often we’re catching issues before they become issues. I’d like to highlight one stat in particular: at the beginning of 2017 our T&S work was almost entirely driven by user reports. Today, more than half of the users and content we action are caught by us proactively using more sophisticated modeling. Often we catch policy violations before being reported or even seen by users or mods.
The greater Reddit community does something incredible every day. In fact, one of the lessons I’ve learned from Reddit is that when people are in the right context, they are more creative, collaborative, supportive, and funnier than we sometimes give ourselves credit for (I’m serious!). A couple great examples from last year include that time you all created an
artistic masterpiece
and that other time you all organized
site-wide grassroots campaigns
for net neutrality. Well done, everybody.
In 2018, we’ll continue our efforts to make Reddit welcoming. Our biggest project continues to be the web redesign. We know you have a lot of questions, so our teams will be doing a series of blog posts and AMAs all about the redesign, starting soon-ish in
r/blog
.
It’s still in alpha with a few thousand users testing it every day, but we’re excited about the progress we’ve made and looking forward to expanding our testing group to more users. (Thanks to all of you who have offered your feedback so far!) If you’d like to join in the fun, we pull testers from
r/beta
. We’ll be dramatically increasing the number of testers soon.
We’re super excited about 2018. The staff and I will hang around to answer questions for a bit.
Happy New Year,
Steve and the Reddit team

Hi everyone!
I’m Alex–I joined Reddit five months ago as the VP of Consumer Product and I’m excited to introduce myself and bring you some good news today.
Who are you?
I work with our product managers and designers to figure out what things we should build. I also work with
u/mart2d2
and our engineering teams to figure out how we should build them. I’ve been a Redditor for eight years and it’s a huge privilege for me to work on improving Reddit as my day job.
In my spare time, I focus on raising my kid (shoutout to
r/daddit
), I play Super Smash Bros. Melee poorly (Falco 4 life), and I love listening to podcasts (RadioLab, 99PI, Imaginary Worlds).
What’s New?
When I arrived in November, I inherited a lot of plans—there are a lot of things to get done at Reddit! We’ve made progress on many fronts since I’ve joined, but there are two items on that original list that we’ve been working on for a long time:
Deliver our first official Android Reddit App.
Improve and stabilize Alien Blue.
Building our first Android Reddit app is a no-brainer for us. Many core Redditors are Android users and it is important for us to deliver an official app experience that makes us proud.
Revamping Alien Blue is also a pretty obvious thing to do, but what started out as a simple improvement project turned into a much larger effort. We’ve decided to rebuild our iPhone app from the ground up to be faster, more modern, and more usable. We’re proud to share with you what we think is be the best way to experience Reddit on iPhone
So here it is: introducing
Reddit for iPhone
and
Reddit for Android
, featuring inline images, night theme, compact and card views, and simpler navigation. Please take a moment to head over to the app stores and check out what we’ve built for you.
What’s Next
This is the beginning of our journey with you, our app users. For everyone joining us on this ride, you can expect a lot of updates and new features that we’ll be rolling out to mobile first. Our first feature releases are getting prepared now and we’ll be updating at least once a month. Of course, if you already have an app you like, you're free to continue enjoying it. We will continue to support our free public api.
Please give our new apps a spin and post love notes, feature requests, roasts, etc., to this thread. We’d love to hear what you think and will be incorporating feedback. I will personally read each top comment (using the Speed Read button in our iPhone app!).
I’ll be hanging out in the comments for a couple of hours to answer any questions you have about our apps and Reddit in general. AMA!
Thanks!

Across the platform, existing communities like
r/science
,
r/askscience
, and
r/worldnews
have joined newly established communities like
r/Coronavirus
and
r/COVID19
to share authoritative content and welcome important discussion every day.
At Reddit Inc., we’ve also been
working
to curate expert discussions and surface the most reliable information for you. And today, we’re excited to launch the Solidarity Award, which seeks to raise funds for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic via the
COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund
for the
World Health Organization (WHO)
. The fund -- which is powered by the
United Nations Foundation
and the
Swiss Philanthropy Foundation
-- supports
WHO’s
work to track and understand the spread of COVID-19, ensure patients get the care they need, frontline workers get essential supplies and information, and accelerate efforts to develop vaccines, tests, and treatments for the pandemic.
Starting today, you can purchase the Solidarity Award directly on Reddit desktop and mobile web (via PayPal or Stripe), and
100% of the proceeds
will benefit the
COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund
for WHO.*
Here are a few details on the Solidarity Award
:
How to find the Award: The Solidarity Award can only be given on Reddit desktop and mobile web (not currently available to give on Mobile apps). You'll find the award towards the bottom of the Medals section in our Award dialog.
The full price of the Award ($3.99) will be donated by Reddit to the United Nation Foundation’s COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund for the

Why are we doing this?
We’ve never felt more urgency or responsibility to fulfill our mission of bringing community and belonging to everyone in the world. The Solidarity Award is meant to complement the efforts of our users, moderators, and employees at Reddit by enabling community-wide charitable giving during a time of great need.
A Heads Up:
The team at Reddit worked quickly to enable the Solidarity Award. As with all new things at this scale, we are keeping an eye out for any bugs and issues that may arise, and will update the experience accordingly.
From Reddit to all of our users:
Stay safe, be vigilant, and take care of one another.

Each year around this time, we share Reddit’s latest transparency report and a few highlights from our Legal team’s efforts to protect user privacy. This year, our annual post happens to coincide with one of the biggest national discussions of privacy online and the integrity of the platforms we use, so I wanted to share a more in-depth update in an effort to be as transparent with you all as possible.
First, here is our
2017 Transparency Report
. This details government and law-enforcement requests for private information about our users. The types of requests we receive most often are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. We require all of these requests to be legally valid, and we push back against those we don’t consider legally justified. In 2017, we received significantly more requests to produce or preserve user account information. The percentage of requests we deemed to be legally valid, however,
decreased slightly for both types of requests
. (You’ll find a full breakdown of these stats, as well as non-governmental requests and DMCA takedown notices, in the report. You can find our transparency reports from previous years
here
.)
We also participated in a number of amicus briefs, joining other tech companies in support of issues we care about. In Hassell v. Bird and Yelp v. Superior Court (Montagna), we argued for the right to defend a user's speech and anonymity if the user is sued. And this year, we've advocated for upholding the net neutrality rules (County of Santa Clara v. FCC) and defending user anonymity against unmasking prior to a lawsuit (Glassdoor v. Andra Group, LP).
I’d also like to give an update to my last post about the
investigation into Russian attempts to exploit Reddit
. I’ve mentioned before that we’re cooperating with Congressional inquiries. In the spirit of transparency, we’re going to share with you what we shared with them earlier today:
In my post last month, I described that we had found and removed a few hundred accounts that were of suspected Russian Internet Research Agency origin. I’d like to share with you more fully what that means. At this point in our investigation, we have found 944 suspicious accounts, few of which had a visible impact on the site:
70% (662) had zero karma
1% (8) had negative karma
22% (203) had 1-999 karma
6% (58) had 1,000-9,999 karma
1% (13) had a karma score of 10,000+
Of the 282 accounts with non-zero karma, more than half (145) were banned prior to the start of this investigation through our routine Trust & Safety practices. All of these bans took place before the 2016 election and in fact, all but 8 of them took place back in 2015. This general pattern also held for the accounts with significant karma: of the 13 accounts with 10,000+ karma, 6 had already been banned prior to our investigation—all of them before the 2016 election. Ultimately, we have seven accounts with significant karma scores that made it past our defenses.
And as I mentioned last time, our investigation did not find any election-related advertisements of the nature found on other platforms, through either our self-serve or managed advertisements. I also want to be very clear that none of the 944 users placed any ads on Reddit. We also did not detect any effective use of these accounts to engage in vote manipulation.
To give you more insight into our findings,
here is a link to all 944 accounts
. We have decided to keep them visible for now, but after a period of time the accounts and their content will be removed from Reddit. We are doing this to allow moderators, investigators, and all of you to see their account histories for yourselves.
We still have a lot of room to improve, and we intend to remain vigilant. Over the past several months, our teams have evaluated our site-wide protections against fraud and abuse to see where we can make those improvements. But I am pleased to say that these investigations have shown that the efforts of our Trust & Safety and Anti-Evil teams are working. It’s also a tremendous testament to the work of our moderators and the healthy skepticism of our communities, which make Reddit a difficult platform to manipulate.
We know the success of Reddit is dependent on
your trust
. We hope continue to build on that by communicating openly with you about these subjects, now and in the future. Thanks for reading. I’ll stick around for a bit to answer questions.

u/Amg137
talked about
why we’re redesigning Reddit on desktop
and
how moderation and community styling will work in it
. Today, I’m here as a hu
man sacrifice m
ember of Reddit’s Design team (surprise: designers actually work at Reddit!) to talk about how we’ve approached the desktop redesign and what we’ve learned from your feedback along the way.
When approaching the redesign, we all learned early on that this wasn’t just about making Reddit more usable, accessible, and efficient; it was also about learning how to interact, adapt, and communicate with the world’s largest, most passionate and genuine community of users.
Better every (feedback) loop
Every team working on this project has its share of longtime redditors—whether it's Product, Design, Engineering, or Community. To say that this has been the most challenging (and rewarding) project of our careers is an understatement. Over the past year we’ve been running surveys internally and externally. We’ve conducted video conferences with first-time users, redditors on their 10th Cake Day, moderators, and lurkers. Not to mention an extremely helpful community of alpha testers. You all have shaped the way we do every part of our jobs, from brainstorming and creating designs to building features and collecting feedback.
Just when we thought we had the optimal approach to a new feature or legacy functionality, you came in and told us where we were wrong and, in most cases, explained to us with passion and clarity why a given feature was important to you—like
making Classic and Compact views fill your screen
(coming soon).
Processing img uk5t2xyv27j01...
What? Reddit is evolving!
Reddit is not a one-size-fits-all experience. It’s a site based on choice and evolution. There are millions of you, spread across different devices, joining Reddit at different times, using the site in widely varying ways, and we're trying to build in a way that supports all of you. So, as we figured out the best way to do that, these are the themes that guided us along the way:
Maintain and extend what makes Reddit, Reddit
Give communities tools
that are simple, intuitive, and flexible—for styling, moderating, communicating subreddit rules, and customizing how each community organizes its content.
Make our desktop experience more welcoming
Lower the barrier to entry for new redditors, while providing choice (e.g., different viewing options:
Card
/
Classic
/
Compact
) and familiarity to all users.
Design a foundation for the future
Establish a design foundation that encourages user insight and allows our team to make improvements quickly, release after release.
Keep content at the forefront
We want to make sure viewing, posting, and interacting with content is easy by keeping our UI and brand elements minimal.
Asking Reddit
As we moved from setting high-level goals to getting into the actual design work, we knew it would be a long process even with the learnings we gained from the initial look-see. We know that our first attempt is never the best, and the only way we can improve is by talking directly with all of you. It’s hard to summarize everything we built as a result of these conversations, but here are a few examples:
Navigation: We wanted to make Reddit simpler to navigate for everyone, so after receiving feedback from our alpha testers, we developed a “hamburger menu” on the left sidebar that made it easy to do everything users wanted it to: quickly find your favorite subreddits and subreddits you moderate, and
filter all of your subscriptions just by typing in a few letters
.
Posting flow: The current interface for submitting text and link posts (aka “Create a post”) can be confusing for new redditors, so we wanted to simplify it and make some long overdue improvements that would address a wide variety of use cases. While users liked the more intuitive look and formatting options we introduced, they gave us additional feedback that led to changes like submit validation, clearly displayed subreddit rules, and options for adding spoiler tags, NSFW tags, and post flair directly when you’re creating.
Listings pages: We know from RES and our mobile apps that many users like an expanded Card View while many longtime users prefer our classic look, so we decided early on that the redesign should offer choice in how users view Reddit. We’ve received a lot of feedback on how each view could be improved (e.g., reducing whitespace in Classic), and we’re working on shipping fixes.
The list of user-inspired changes goes on and on (and we’re expecting a lot more
i
teration as we expand our testing pool), but this is how we’ve worked through design challenges so far.
It’s
never over
The redesign isn’t finished at “GA” (General Availability, or as I like to call it, “Time to Breathe for One Day Before We Get Back to Work”). With this post, we wanted to share some context on our approach, thank everyone who's participated in
r/redesign
so far (THANK YOU!), and let you know we will continue to engage with you on a daily basis to understand how you’re responding to what we’re building.
Over the next several weeks, we'll be expanding the number of users who have access to the alpha (yes, you will be able to opt out if you prefer the current desktop look), hearing what you think, and updating all of you as we make more changes. In the meantime, I'll be sticking around in the comments for a bit to answer questions and
invite all of you to listen to Huey Lewis with me
.
EDIT: Thank you for all your comments, feedback, and suggestions so far. I gotta get back to the whole working-on-the-redesign thing, but I’ll be jumping back into the comments when I can over the rest of the day.",
announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3sbrro/account_suspensions_a_transparent_alternative_to/,18177,3677,Account suspensions: A transparent alternative to shadowbans,"Today we’re rolling out a new type of account restriction called suspensions.  Suspensions will replace
shadowbans
for the vast majority of real humans and increase transparency when handling users who violate
Reddit’s content policy
.
How it works
Suspensions can only be applied to accounts by the Reddit admins (not moderators).
Suspended accounts will always receive a notification about the suspension including reason and the duration:
See example notification PM
- Sent to user account from
r/reddit.com
See example on-page notification
- Shown on pages while an account is suspended
Suspended users can reply to the notification PM to appeal their suspension
Suspensions can be temporary or permanent, depending on the severity of infraction and the user’s previous infractions.
What it does to an account
Suspended users effectively have their account put into read-only mode.  The primary actions they will not be able to perform are:
Voting
Submitting posts
Commenting
Sending private messages
Moderators who have been suspended will not be able to perform any mod actions or access modmail while the suspension is in effect.
You can see
the full list of forbidden actions for suspended users here
.
Users in both temporary and permanent suspensions will always be able to delete/edit their posts and comments as usual.
Users browsing on a desktop version of the site will see a
pop-up notice
or
notification page
anytime they try and perform an action they are forbidden from doing.  App users will receive an error depending on how each app developer chooses to indicate the status of suspended accounts.
User pages
Visiting the user page of an account that has been permanently suspended will
indicate that the account has been suspended
and will not display any other data.
Visiting the user page of an account that has been temporarily suspended will not give any indication that the account is currently suspended.
In addition to this, we have also updated user pages for deleted accounts to clearly
display that the account in question was deleted by the user
.
Why this is a good thing
Our current form of account restriction,
the shadowban
, is great for dealing with bots/spam rings but woefully inadequate for real human beings.  We think suspensions are a vast improvement.
Suspensions inform people when they’ve broken the rules.  While this seems like a no-brainer, this helps so we can identify the specific behavior that caused the suspension.
Users are given a chance to correct their behavior.  We’re all human and we all make mistakes.  Reddit believes in the goodness of people.  We think most people won’t intentionally continue to violate a rule after being notified.
Suspensions can vary in length depending on the severity of the infraction and user’s history.  This allows flexibility when applying suspensions. Different types of infraction can have different responses.
Increased transparency.  We want to be upfront about suspending user accounts to both the user being suspended and other users (where appropriate).

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/dbf9nj/changes_to_our_policy_against_bullying_and/,17351,9943,Changes to Our Policy Against Bullying and Harassment,"TL;DR is that we’re updating our harassment and bullying policy so we can be more responsive to your reports.
Hey everyone,
We wanted to let you know about some changes that we are making today to our
Content Policy
regarding content that
threatens, harasses, or bullies
, which you can read in full
here
.
Why are we doing this?
These changes, which were many months in the making, were primarily driven by feedback we received from you all, our users, indicating to us that there was a problem with the narrowness of our previous policy. Specifically, the old policy required a behavior to be “continued” and/or “systematic” for us to be able to take action against it as harassment. It also set a high bar of users fearing for their real-world safety to qualify, which we think is an incorrect calibration. Finally, it wasn’t clear that abuse toward both individuals and groups qualified under the rule. All these things meant that too often, instances of harassment and bullying, even egregious ones, were left unactioned. This was a bad user experience for you all, and frankly, it is something that made us feel not-great too. It was clearly a case of the letter of a rule not matching its spirit.
The changes we’re making today are trying to better address that, as well as to give some meta-context about the spirit of this rule: chiefly, Reddit is a place for conversation. Thus, behavior whose core effect is to shut people out of that conversation through intimidation or abuse has no place on our platform.
We also hope that this change will take some of the burden off moderators, as it will expand our ability to take action at scale against content that the vast majority of subreddits already have their own rules against-- rules that we support and encourage.
How will these changes work in practice?
We all know that context is critically important here, and can be tricky, particularly when we’re talking about typed words on the internet. This is why we’re hoping today’s changes will help us better leverage human user reports. Where previously, we required the harassment victim to make the report to us directly, we’ll now be investigating reports from bystanders as well. We hope this will alleviate some of the burden on the harassee.
You should also know that we’ll also be harnessing some improved machine-learning tools to help us better sort and prioritize human user reports. But don’t worry, machines will only help us organize and prioritize user reports. They won’t be banning content or users on their own. A human user still has to report the content in order to surface it to us. Likewise, all actual decisions will still be made by a human admin.
As with any rule change, this will take some time to fully enforce. Our
response times have improved significantly since the start of the year
, but we’re always striving to move faster. In the meantime, we encourage moderators to take this opportunity to examine their community rules and make sure that they are not creating an environment where bullying or harassment are tolerated or encouraged.
What should I do if I see content that I think breaks this rule?
As always, if you see or experience behavior that you believe is in violation of this rule, please use the report button [“This is abusive or harassing > “It’s targeted harassment”] to let us know. If you believe an entire user account or subreddit is dedicated to harassing or bullying behavior against an individual or group, we want to know that too;
report it to us here
.
Thanks. As usual, we’ll hang around for a bit and answer questions.

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/ipitt0/today_were_testing_a_new_way_to_discuss_political/,17318,2,Today we’re testing a new way to discuss political ads (and announcements),"In case you missed
the
billboards
,
blog posts
, and
AMAs
, we’re doing our best to encourage people on and off Reddit to vote this year. Along with our
Up the Vote campaign
and
ongoing security and safety work
to guard against shenanigans, we’ve also been evolving how we handle another important aspect of the election process:
political ads
.
First, some background
Political ads have been a relatively quiet part of Reddit for many years. Last year, in thinking through what the right balance was between unfettered political ads and prohibiting them altogether for 2020 (both approaches that other platforms have taken), we decided on
a policy we felt was the best approach for Reddit
: no misinformation, human review of the ads and where they link, a subreddit listing all political ads (
r/RedditPoliticalAds
), and a requirement to keep comments on for 24 hours.
Since debuting this policy earlier this year, the last condition (requiring comments to remain on) has enabled redditors to discuss political ads—providing more context in the comments and even offering counterarguments—but so far it’s only been lightly used. As we get closer to November, however, the prominence of and discussion around political ads will increase, and, with it, the need for a clear moderation system for these comments.
The problem we’re addressing
As I mentioned
a couple months back
, unmoderated spaces on Reddit are an area we want to improve, from Modmail to PM’s, and political ads pose a unique challenge.
If the OP of a political ad (i.e., a campaign) moderates the comments, it’s problematic: they might remove dissenting perspectives. And if we (the admins) moderate the comments of a political ad, it’s even more problematic, putting us in the position of either moderating too much or too little, with inevitable accusations of bias either way.
The problem, we realized, is similar to what we see in
r/announcements
: lots of people commenting on a highly visible post outside the context of a community. It’s fair to say that
r/announcements
isn’t really a community; it lacks the culture, cohesion, and moderation that benefit most other subreddits, and as a result, the quality of conversation has deteriorated as the audience has grown.
Ultimately, conversations really only happen in the context of a community, and neither
r/announcements
nor political ads with comments on provide this. We believe we can foster better discussion on both with a different approach.
What we’re testing today
Instead of having the usual free-for-all of comments on the
r/announcements
post itself, we are trying out a new experience today that encourages discussion of this post within other communities—an approach we hope works for political ads as well.
Below is a stickied comment with a link to submit this post to other communities on Reddit and a list of those discussion posts. The stickied comment will update automatically with new posts.
A few other details to note for this test:
The discussion posts are like any other post
, which means they can be voted on by users and removed by mods.
Communities that don’t want to participate don’t have to.
(If you’re a mod of a community where a user attempts to crosspost this, you will get a Modmail alerting you to this with
opt-out instructions
.)
Individual community rules apply to these posts just as any other
, so read the rules before attempting to bring the discussion into a completely unrelated community.
Our stickied comment will link to discussions only from communities subject to our ads allow list.
Communities that have already opted not to appear in
r/all
won’t appear in the comment either, even if there is a discussion of this post there.
After today’s test, we will likely test this system with political ads.
This test will be a success if there are a variety of posts and conversations about this post, even—and perhaps particularly—if they are critical.
How we’re answering questions
r/announcements
posts have an important difference from political ads: I treat them as AMAs and do my best to answer questions and respond to criticism (both of which I appreciate). With this approach, I expect doing so will be more difficult (at least this first time). However, the point of this test is not to make you hunt for our answers or for us to reply to fewer questions, and we don’t intend to use this approach for all our admin posts (e.g., in
r/ModNews
,
r/changelog
,
r/ModSupport
, and others, which are smaller subreddits that still work well).
For today, we’re going to make the first link of this post to
r/ModNews
and start by answering mods’ questions there. In a future announcement, we may ask a specific community if they would host us for the discussion that day (depending on what the announcement is) and set that as an official destination for discussion, like a regular AMA.
Additionally, I’ll do my best to find other places to respond, and we’ll maintain another comment below this post to list replies we’ve given outside of
r/announcements
so you can easily find our responses (which was a feature request from
our post
last week).
Ultimately, the goal of this test is to enable Reddit to do what Reddit does best: facilitate conversations (within the context of a community), provide commentary on political ads the way redditors already do on news and politics daily (sharing more information and calling bullshit in the comments when necessary), and extend the discussion well beyond the scope of the original post.
Thank you for participating. We hope this approach sets the stage for successful commentary not just today but down the road on political ads as well.
Steve
​
Edit (9/28/20):
Update: After initial testing and a few small tweaks to the sorting and score display of the links in stickied comments like the one below, we’ll be using this discussion system on political ads moving forward.
As I mentioned, our goal with this approach was to encourage these types of discussions to happen within the context of a community. While this feature is completely optional for communities (opt-out instructions
here
), we were pleased overall with the level of engagement that we saw from communities and users on this test post.
We’re still exploring how we’ll use this feature for
r/announcements
posts and how we can work with specific communities to have discussions about them. In the meantime, you can see our updated political ads policy on our

Hello again!
It’s been a minute since
my last post here
, so I wanted to take some time out from our usual product and policy updates,
meme safety reports
, and waiting for
r/livecounting
to reach 10,000,000
to share some highlights from the past few months and talk about our plans for the months ahead.
We started off the quarter with a
win for net neutrality
, but as always, the fight against the Dark Side continues, with
Europe passing a new copyright directive
that may strike a real blow to the open internet. Nevertheless, we will continue to fight for the open internet (and occasionally pester you with posts encouraging you to fight for it, too).
We also had a lot of fun fighting for the
not-so-free
but perfectly balanced world of
r/thanosdidnothingwrong
. I’m always amazed to see redditors so engaged with their communities that they get
Snoo tattoos
.
Speaking of bans, you’ve probably noticed that over the past few months we’ve banned a few subreddits and
quarantined
several more. We don't take the banning of subreddits lightly, but we will continue to enforce our policies (and be transparent with all of you when we make changes to them) and use other tools to encourage a healthy ecosystem for communities. We’ve been investing heavily in our Anti-Evil and Trust & Safety teams, as well as a new team devoted solely to investigating and preventing efforts to interfere with our site, state-sponsored and otherwise. We also recognize the ways that redditors themselves actively help flag potential suspicious actors, and we’re working on a system to allow you all to
report directly to this team
.
On the product side, our teams have been hard at work shipping countless updates to our
iOS
and
Android
apps, like universal search and News. We’ve also expanded Chat on mobile and desktop and launched an opt-in subreddit chat, which we’ve already seen communities using for game-day discussions and chats about TV shows. We started testing out a new hub for
OC (Original Content)
and a
Save Drafts feature
(with shared drafts as well) for text and link posts in the redesign.
Speaking of which, we’ve made a ton of improvements to the redesign since we last talked about it in April.
Including but not limited to… night mode, user & post flair improvements,
better traffic pages for
mods
, accessibility improvements, keyboard shortcuts, a bunch of new community widgets, fixing key AutoMod integrations, and the ability to
have community styling show up on mobile as well
, which was one of the main reasons why we took on the redesign in the first place. I know you all have had a lot of feedback since we first launched it (
I have too
). Our teams have poured a tremendous amount of work into shipping improvements, and their #1 focus now is on improving performance. If you haven’t checked it out in a while, I encourage you to
give it a spin
.
Last but not least, on the community front, we just wrapped our second annual Moderator Thank You Roadshow, where the rest of the admins and I got the chance to meet mods in different cities, have
a bit of fun
, and chat about Reddit. We also launched a new
Mod Help Center
and new mod tools for Chat and the redesign, with more fun stuff (like Modmail Search) on the way.
Other than that, I can’t imagine we have much to talk about, but I’ll hang to around some questions anyway.

If you have your push notifications enabled on our mobile apps, or desktop notifications enabled, you should receive one. We are working on expanding this feature to all users, even without push notifications. The follower list is still delayed until later this year.
Hi everyone,
We collect a lot of feedback from you all, and one theme we’ve heard consistently from users is that many of you want more visibility when users follow you. As we move the new profiles out of beta, we wanted to share a transparency change we are making. In the coming months, we will allow people to see which users follow them.
We know that this may be a change from existing expectations, so we want to give you time to update your settings before moving forward with this. In the immediate future (starting Aug 19th, 2019), this will only affect new follows made. In about 3 months, we will make it possible to see your full list of followers. This would include follows made while profiles were in beta.
We plan to send a PM to all affected users, but wanted to make this public post as well so that you aren’t surprised when you receive it. To be clear, the usernames will only be visible to the user who was followed. No one will be able to look up your full list of subscriptions/follows and no one else will be able to see a list of followers of a profile.
If you are someone who follows other users, please take a second to examine your subscription/follow list and make sure you are comfortable with those users being aware that you follow them. If you are someone who has followers, we will make another post when the ability to view your followers has been released. We’ll stick around in the comments for a bit if you have questions. If there are other features you’d like to see for profiles, please let us know!
Thanks!

Hi Mods,
As we all know, Reddit provides a home for an infinite number of people and communities. From awws and memes, to politics, fantasy leagues, and book clubs, people have created communities for just about everything. There are also entire communities dedicated solely to finding someone to talk to like
r/KindVoice
and
r/CasualConversation
. But it’s not all funny memes and gaming—as an anonymous platform, Reddit is also a space for people to express the most vulnerable parts of themselves.
People on Reddit find help in support communities that address a broad range of challenges from quitting smoking or drinking, struggling to get pregnant, or addressing abuse, anxiety, depression, or thoughts of suicide. Even communities that don’t directly relate to serious topics can get deep into serious issues, and the person you turn to in a time of need may be someone you bonded with over a game, a shared sense of humor, or the same taste in music.
When you see a post or comment about suicidal feelings in a community, it can be overwhelming. Especially if you’re a moderator in that community, and feel a sense of responsibility for both the people in your community and making sure it's the type of place you want it to be.
Here at Reddit, we’ve been working on finding a thoughtful approach to self-harm and suicide response that does a few key things:
Connects people considering suicide or serious self-harm with with trusted resources and real-time support that can help them as soon as possible.
Takes the pressure of responding to people considering suicide or serious self-harm off of moderators and redditors.
Continues to uphold our high standards for protecting and respecting user privacy and anonymity.
To help us with that new approach, today we’re announcing a partnership with
Crisis Text Line
to provide redditors who may be considering serious self-harm or suicide with free, confidential, 24/7 support from trained Crisis Counselors.
Crisis Text Line is a free, confidential, text-based support line for people in the U.S. who may be struggling with any type of mental health crisis. Their Crisis Counselors are trained to put people at ease and help them make a plan to stay safe. If you’d like to learn more about Crisis Text Line, they have a helpful
summary video of their work
on their website and the complete story of how they were founded was covered in-depth in the
New Yorker article,
R U There?
How It Will Work
Moving forward, when you’re worried about someone in your community, or anywhere on Reddit, you can let us know in two ways:
Report the specific post or comment that worried you and select,
Someone is considering suicide or serious self-harm.
Visit the person’s profile and select,
Get them help and support.
(If you’re using Reddit on the web, click
More Options
first.)
We’ll reach out to tell the person a fellow redditor is worried about them and put them in touch with Crisis Text Line’s trained Crisis Counselors. Don’t worry, we’ll have some rate-limiting behind the scenes so people in crisis won’t get multiple messages in short succession, regardless of the amount of requests we receive. And because responding to someone who is considering suicide or serious self-harm can bring up hard emotions or may be triggering, Crisis Text Line is also available to people who are reporting someone. This new flow will be launching next week.
Here’s what it will look like:

a lot
of
recent password dumps
made available on the parts of the internet most of us generally avoid.  With this access to likely username and password combinations, we've noticed a general uptick in account takeovers (ATOs) by malicious (or at best spammy) third parties.
Though Reddit itself has not been exploited, even the best security in the world won't work when users are
reusing passwords between sites
.  We've ramped up our ability to detect the takeovers, and sent out 100k password resets in the last 2 weeks.  More are to come as we continue to verify and validate that no one except for you is using your account.  But, to make everyone's life easier and to help ensure that the next time you log in you aren't greeted a request to reset your password:
Choose a
strong,
unique
password
.  The emphasis here is important.  I don't mean ""use that really good password you use on sites you care about.""  I mean
""one that is used for Reddit and Reddit alone!""
Password reuse is really bad!
We care a lot about security, but we can't do anything about the security of that
other
site you use the same password on who decides not to use
bcrypt
but rather a
nifty hashing scheme of their own devising!
Set and verify an email address
.  We currently have exactly one way for you to reset your account and that's by email.  For almost 11 years we've been respectful of your not wanting to necessarily give us an email address.  If your account gets taken over and you've got no reset email, you're going to have a bad time.
Check your own account activity page!
If you see some IPs in there that you don't recognize (and especially ones from countries you don't spend much time in), it's probably not a bad idea to
change your password
.  This might break any integrations you have with 3rd parties you've shared your credentials with, but it's easy to re-auth.
On a related point, a quick note about throw-aways: throw-away accounts are fine, but we have tons of completely abandoned accounts with no discernible history and exist as placeholders in our database. They've never posted. They've never voted.  They haven't logged in
for several years
.   They are also a huge possible surface area for ATOs, because I generally don't want to think about (though I do) how many of them have the password ""hunter2"". Shortly, we're going to start issuing password resets to these accounts and, if we don't get a reaction in about a month, we're going to disable them. Please keep an eye out!
Q
:
But how do I make a unique password?
A
: Personally I'm a big fan of tools like
LastPass
and
1Password
because they generate completely random passwords.  There are also some well-known
heuristics
.  [Note: lmk of your favorites here and I'll edit in a plug.]
Q
:
What's with the fear mongering??
A
:
It's been a rough month.
Also,
don't just take it from me this is important.
Q
:
Jeez, guys why don't you enable two-factor authentication (2FA) already?
A
: We're definitely considering it.  In fact, admins are required to have 2FA set up to use the administrative parts of the site.  It's behind a second authentication layer to make sure that if
we
get hacked, the most that an attacker can do is post something smug and self serving with a little [A] after it, which...well nevermind.
Unfortunately, to roll this out further, reddit has a
huge
ecosystem
of
apps
, including our newly released
iOS
and
android
clients, to say nothing of integrations like with ifttt.com and that script you wrote as a school project that you forgot to shut off.  ""Adding 2FA to the login flow"" will require a lot of coordination.
Q
:
Sure.  First you come to delete inactive accounts, then it'll be...!
A
: Please. Stop.  We're not talking about removing content, and so we're certainly not going to be removing users that have a history.  If ATOs are a brush fire, abandoned, unused accounts are dry kindling.  Besides, we all know
who the enemy is
and
why!
Q
:
Do you realize you linked to
https://www.reddit.com/prefs/update/
like three times?
A
: Actually it was four.

:  As promised (and thanks everyone for the suggestions!) I'd like to call out the following:

ask about
or
change their views on a wide range of topics
, share
personal, intimate feelings
, or
post cat
pictures
. This leads to great communities and deep meaningful discussions.  But, sometimes this very openness can lead to less awesome stuff like spam, trolling, and worse, harassment.  We work hard to deal with these when they occur publicly.  Today, we’re happy to announce that we’ve just released a feature to help you filter them from within your own inbox: user blocking.
Believe it or not, we’ve actually had a
""block user"" feature
in a basic form for
quite a while
, though over time its utility focused to apply to only private messages.
We’ve recently updated
its behavior to apply more broadly: you can now block users that reply to you in comment replies as well.  Simply click the “Block User” button while viewing the reply in your inbox. From that point on, the profile of the blocked user, along with all their comments, posts, and messages, will then be completely removed from your view.  You will no longer be alerted if they message you further.  As before, the block is
completely silent to the blocked user
.  Blocks can be viewed or removed on
your preferences page here
.
Our changes to user blocking are intended to let you decide what your boundaries are, and to give you the option to
choose
what you want—or don’t want—to be exposed to. [And, of course, you can and should still always
report
harassment to our community team!]
These are just our first steps toward improving the experience of using Reddit, and we’re looking forward to announcing many more.",

I would like to take a minute to look back on 2016 and share what is in store for Reddit in 2017.
2016 was a transformational year for Reddit. We are a completely different company than we were a year ago, having improved in just about every dimension. We hired most of the company, creating many new teams and growing the rest. As a result, we are capable of building more than ever before.
Last year was our most productive ever. We shipped well-reviewed apps for both
iOS
and
Android
. It is crazy to think these apps did not exist a year ago—especially considering they now account for over 40% of our content views. Despite being relatively new and not yet having all the functionality of the desktop site, the apps are fastest and best way to browse Reddit. If you haven’t given them a try yet, you should definitely take them for a spin.
Additionally, we built a new web tech stack, upon which we built the long promised new version
moderator mail
and our
mobile website
. We added
image hosting
on all platforms as well, which now supports the majority of images uploaded to Reddit.
We want Reddit to be a welcoming place for all. We know we still have a long way to go, but I want to share with you some of the progress we have made. Our Anti-Evil and Trust & Safety teams reduced spam by over 90%, and we released the first version of our
blocking tool
, which made a nice dent in reported abuse. In the wake of
Spezgiving
, we increased actions taken against individual bad actors by nine times. Your continued engagement helps us make the site better for everyone, thank you for that feedback.
As always, the Reddit community did many wonderful things for the world. You raised a
lot
of
money
; stepped up to help
grieving
families
; and even helped
diagnose
a rare genetic disorder. There are stories like this every day, and they are one of the reasons why we are all so proud to work here. Thank you.
We have lot upcoming this year. Some of the things we are working on right now include a new frontpage algorithm, improved performance on all platforms, and
moderation tools on mobile
(native support to follow). We will publish our yearly transparency report in March.
One project I would like to preview is a rewrite of the desktop website. It is a long time coming. The desktop website has not meaningfully changed in many years; it is not particularly welcoming to new users (or old for that matter); and still runs code from the earliest days of Reddit over ten years ago. We know there are implications for community styles and various browser extensions. This is a massive project, and the transition is going to take some time. We are going to need a lot of volunteers to help with testing: new users, old users, creators, lurkers, mods,

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2fpdax/time_to_talk/,14395,8612,Time to talk,"Alright folks,
this discussion
has pretty obviously devolved and we're not getting anywhere. The blame for that definitely lies with us. We're trying to explain some of what has been going on here, but the simultaneous banning of that set of subreddits entangled in this situation has hurt our ability to have that conversation with you, the community. A lot of people are saying what we're doing here reeks of bullshit, and I don't blame them.
I'm not going to ask that you agree with me, but I hope that reading this will give you a better understanding of the decisions we've been poring over constantly over the past week, and perhaps give the community some deeper insight and understanding of what is happening here. I would ask, but obviously not require, that you read this fully and carefully before responding or voting on it. I'm going to give you the very raw breakdown of what has been going on at reddit, and it is likely to be coloured by my own personal opinions. All of us working on this over the past week are fucking exhausted, including myself, so you'll have to forgive me if this seems overly dour.
Also, as an aside, my main job at reddit is systems administration. I take care of the servers that run the site. It isn't my job to interact with the community, but I try to do what I can. I'm certainly not the best communicator, so please feel free to ask for clarification on anything that might be unclear.
With that said, here is what has been happening at reddit, inc over the past week.
A very shitty thing happened this past Sunday. A number of very private and personal photos were stolen and spread across the internet. The fact that these photos belonged to celebrities increased the interest in them by orders of magnitude, but that in no way means they were any less harmful or deplorable. If the same thing had happened to anyone you hold dear, it'd make you sick to your stomach with grief and anger.
When the photos went out, they inevitably got linked to on reddit. As more people became aware of them, we started getting a huge amount of traffic, which broke the site in several ways.
That same afternoon, we held an internal emergency meeting to figure out what we were going to do about this situation. Things were going pretty crazy in the moment, with many folks out for the weekend, and the site struggling to stay afloat. We had some immediate issues we had to address. First, the amount of traffic hitting this content was breaking the site in various ways. Second, we were already getting DMCA and takedown notices by the owners of these photos. Third, if we were to remove anything on the site, whether it be for technical, legal, or ethical obligations, it would likely result in a backlash where things kept getting posted over and over again, thwarting our efforts and possibly making the situation worse.
The decisions which we made amidst the chaos on Sunday afternoon were the following: I would do what I could, including disabling functionality on the site, to keep things running (this was a pretty obvious one). We would handle the DMCA requests as they came in, and recommend that the rights holders contact the company hosting these images so that they could be removed. We would also continue to monitor the site to see where the activity was unfolding, especially in regards to
/r/all
(we didn't want
/r/all
to be primarily covered with links to stolen nudes, deal with it). I'm not saying all of these decisions were correct, or morally defensible, but it's what we did based on our best judgement in the moment, and our experience with similar incidents in the past.
In the following hours, a lot happened. I had to break
/r/thefappening
a few times to keep the site from completely falling over, which as expected resulted in an immediate creation of a new slew of subreddits. Articles in the press were flying out and we were getting comment requests left and right. Many community members were understandably angered at our lack of action or response, and made that known in various ways.
Later that day we were alerted that some of these photos depicted minors, which is where we have drawn a clear line in the sand. In response we immediately started removing things on reddit which we found to be linking to those pictures, and also recommended that the image hosts be contacted so they could be removed more permanently. We do not allow links on reddit to child pornography or images which sexualize children. If you disagree with that stance, and believe reddit cannot draw that line while also being a platform, I'd encourage you to leave.
This nightmare of the weekend made myself and many of my coworkers feel pretty awful. I had an obvious responsibility to keep the site up and running, but seeing that all of my efforts were due to a huge number of people scrambling to look at stolen private photos didn't sit well with me personally, to say the least. We hit new traffic milestones, ones which I'd be ashamed to share publicly. Our general stance on this stuff is that reddit is a platform, and there are times when platforms get used for very deplorable things. We take down things we're legally required to take down, and do our best to keep the site getting from spammed or manipulated, and beyond that we
try
to keep our hands off. Still, in the moment, seeing what we were seeing happen, it was hard to see much merit to that viewpoint.
As the week went on, press stories went out and debate flared everywhere. A lot of focus was obviously put on us, since reddit was clearly one of the major places people were using to find these photos. We continued to receive DMCA takedowns as these images were constantly rehosted and linked to on reddit, and in response we continued to remove what we were legally obligated to, and beyond that instructed the rights holders on how to contact image hosts.
Meanwhile, we were having a huge amount of debate internally at reddit, inc. A lot of members on our team could not understand what we were doing here, why we were continuing to allow ourselves to be party to this flagrant violation of privacy, why we hadn't made a statement regarding what was going on, and how on earth we got to this point. It was messy, and continues to be. The pseudo-result of all of this debate and argument has been that we should continue to be as open as a platform as we can be, and that while we in no way condone or agree with this activity, we should not intervene beyond what the law requires. The arguments for and against are numerous, and this is not a comfortable stance to take in this situation, but it is what we have decided on.
That brings us to today. After painfully arriving at a stance internally, we felt it necessary to make a statement on the reddit blog. We could have let this die down in silence, as it was already tending to do, but we felt it was critical that we have this conversation with our community. If you haven't read it yet,
please do so
.
So, we posted the message in the blog, and then we obliviously did something which heavily confused that message: We banned
/r/thefappening
and related subreddits. The confusion which was generated in the community was obvious, immediate, and massive, and we even had internal team members surprised by the combination. Why are we sending out a message about how we're being open as a platform, and not changing our stance, and then immediately banning the subreddits involved in this mess?
The answer is probably not satisfying, but it's the truth, and the only answer we've got. The situation we had in our hands was the following:  These subreddits were of course the focal point for the sharing of these stolen photos. The images which were DMCAd were continually being reposted constantly on the subreddit. We would takedown images (thumbnails) in response to those DMCAs, but it quickly devolved into a game of whack-a-mole. We'd execute a takedown, someone would adjust, reupload, and then repeat. This same practice was occurring with the underage photos, requiring our constant intervention. The mods were doing their best to keep things under control and in line with the
site rules
, but problems were still constantly overflowing back to us. Additionally, many nefarious parties recognized the popularity of these images, and started spamming them in various ways and attempting to infect or scam users viewing them. It became obvious that we were either going to have to watch these subreddits constantly, or shut them down. We chose the latter. It's obviously not going to solve the problem entirely, but it will at least mitigate the constant issues we were facing. This was an extreme circumstance, and we used the best judgement we could in response.
Now, after all of the context from above, I'd like to respond to some of the common questions and concerns which folks are raising. To be extremely frank, I find
some
of the lines of reasoning that have generated these questions to be batshit insane. Still, in the vacuum of information which we have created, I recognize that we have given rise to much of this strife. As such I'll try to answer even the things which I find to be the most off-the-wall.
Q: You're only doing this in response to pressure from the public/press/celebrities/Conde/Advance/other!
A: The press and nature of this incident obviously made this issue extremely public, but it was not the reason why we did what we did. If you read all of the above, hopefully you can be recognize that the actions we have taken were our own, for our own internal reasons. I can't force anyone to believe this of course, you'll simply have to decide what you believe to be the truth based on the information available to you.
Q: Why aren't you banning these other subreddits which contain deplorable content?!
A: We remove what we're required to remove by law, and what violates any
rules
which we have set forth. Beyond that, we feel it is necessary to maintain as neutral a platform as possible, and to let the communities on reddit be represented by the actions of the people who participate in them. I believe the
blog post
speaks very well to this.
We have banned
/r/TheFappening
and related subreddits, for reasons I outlined above.
Q: You're doing this because of the IAmA app launch to please celebs!
A: No, I can say absolutely and clearly that the IAmA app had zero bearing on our course of decisions regarding this event. I'm sure it is exciting and intriguing to think that there is some clandestine connection, but it's just not there.
Q: Are you planning on taking down all copyrighted material across the site?
A: We take down what we're required to by law, which may include thumbnails, in response to valid DMCA takedown requests. Beyond that we tell claimants to contact whatever host is actually serving content. This policy will not be changing.
Q: You profited on the gold given to users in these deplorable subreddits! Give it back / Give it to charity!
A: This is a tricky issue, one which we haven't figured out yet and that I'd welcome input on. Gold was purchased by our users, to give to other users. Redirecting their funds to a random charity which the original payer may not support is not something we're going to do. We also do not feel that it is right for us to decide that certain things should not receive gold. The user purchasing it decides that. We don't hold this stance because we're money hungry (the amount of money in question is small).
That's all I have. Please forgive any confusing bits above, it's very late and I've written this in urgency. I'll be around for as long as I can to answer questions in the comments.",
announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3djjxw/lets_talk_content_ama/,14097,20952,Let's talk content. AMA.,"We started Reddit to be—as we said back then with our tongues in our cheeks—“The front page of the Internet.” Reddit was to be a source of enough news, entertainment, and random distractions to fill an entire day of pretending to work, every day. Occasionally, someone would start spewing hate, and I would ban them. The community rarely questioned me. When they did, they accepted my reasoning: “because I don’t want that content on our site.”
As we grew, I became increasingly uncomfortable projecting my worldview on others. More practically, I didn’t have time to pass judgement on everything, so I decided to judge nothing.
So we entered a phase that can best be described as Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell. This worked temporarily, but once people started paying attention, few liked what they found. A handful of painful controversies usually resulted in the removal of a few communities, but with inconsistent reasoning and no real change in policy.
One thing that isn't up for debate is why Reddit exists. Reddit is a place to have open and authentic discussions. The reason we’re careful to restrict speech is because people have more open and authentic discussions when they aren't worried about the speech police knocking down their door. When our purpose comes into conflict with a policy, we make sure our purpose wins.
As Reddit has grown, we've seen additional examples of how unfettered free speech can make Reddit a less enjoyable place to visit, and can even cause people harm outside of Reddit. Earlier this year,
Reddit took a stand and banned non-consensual pornography
. This was largely accepted by the community, and the world is a better place as a result (Google and Twitter have followed suit). Part of the reason this went over so well was because there was a very clear line of what was unacceptable.
Therefore, today we're announcing that we're considering a set of additional restrictions on what people can say on Reddit—or at least say on our public pages—in the spirit of our mission.
These types of content are prohibited [1]:
Spam
Anything illegal (i.e. things that are actually illegal, such as copyrighted material. Discussing illegal activities, such as drug use, is not illegal)
Publication of someone’s private and confidential information
Anything that incites harm or violence against an individual or group of people (it's ok to say ""I don't like this group of people."" It's not ok to say, ""I'm going to kill this group of people."")
Anything that
harasses, bullies, or abuses
an individual or group of people (these behaviors intimidate others into silence)[2]
Sexually suggestive content featuring minors
There are other types of content that are specifically classified:
Adult content must be flagged as NSFW (Not Safe For Work). Users must opt into seeing NSFW communities. This includes pornography, which is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it.
Similar to NSFW, another type of content that is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it, is the content that violates a common sense of decency. This classification will require a login, must be opted into, will not appear in search results or public listings, and will generate no revenue for Reddit.
We've had the NSFW classification since nearly the beginning, and it's worked well to separate the pornography from the rest of Reddit. We believe there is value in letting all views exist, even if we find some of them abhorrent, as long as they don’t pollute people’s enjoyment of the site. Separation and opt-in techniques have worked well for keeping adult content out of the common Redditor’s listings, and we think it’ll work for this other type of content as well.
No company is perfect at addressing these hard issues. We’ve spent the last few days here discussing and agree that an approach like this allows us as a company to repudiate content we don’t want to associate with the business, but gives individuals freedom to consume it if they choose. This is what we will try, and if the hateful users continue to spill out into mainstream reddit, we will try more aggressive approaches. Freedom of expression is important to us, but it’s more important to us that we at reddit be true to our mission.
[1] This is basically what we have right now. I’d appreciate your thoughts. A very clear line is important and our language should be precise.
[2] Wording we've used elsewhere is this ""Systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person (1) conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or (2) fear for their safety or the safety of those around them.""

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8m2yr4/were_updating_our_user_agreement_and_privacy/,14008,1819,"We’re updating our User Agreement and Privacy Policy (effective June 8, 2018!)","Hi all,
Today we’re posting updates to our
User Agreement
and
Privacy Policy
that will become effective June 8, 2018.  For those of you that don’t know me, I’m one of the original engineers of Reddit,
left
and then returned in 2016 (as was the style of the time), and am currently CTO.  As a
very, very early redditor
, I know the importance of these issues to the community, so I’ve been working with our Legal team on ensuring that we think about privacy and security in a technical way and continue to make progress (and are
transparent
with all of you) in how we think about these issues.
To summarize the changes and help explain the “why now?”:
Updated for changes to our services.
It’s
been a long time
since
our last significant User Agreement update
.  In general, *these* revisions are to bring the terms up to date and to reflect changes in the services we offer. For example, some of the products mentioned in the terms we’re replacing are no longer available (RIP redditmade and reddit.tv), we’ve created a more
robust API process
, and we’ve launched
some
new
features
!
European data protection law.
Many of the changes to the Privacy Policy relate to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). You might have heard about GDPR from such emails as “Updates to our Privacy Policy” and “Reminder: Important update to our Terms of Service & Privacy Policy.”  In fact, you might have noticed that just about everything you’ve ever signed up for is sending these sorts of notices.  We added information about the rights of users in the European Economic Area under the new law, the legal bases for our processing data from those users, and contact details for our legal representative in Europe.
Clarity.
While these docs are longer, our terms and privacy policy do not give us any new rights to use your data; we are just trying to be more clear so that you understand your rights and obligations of using our products and services.  We rearranged both documents so that similar topics are in the same section or in closer proximity to each other.  Some of the sections are more concise (like the Copyright, DMCA & Takedown section in the User Agreement), although there has been no change to the applicable laws or our takedown policies.  Some of the sections are more specific.  For example, the new Things You Cannot Do section has most of the same terms as before that were in various places in the previous User Agreement.  Finally, we removed some repetitive items with our content policy (e.g., “don’t mess with Reddit” in the user agreement is the same as our prohibition on “Breaking Reddit” in the content policy).
Our work won’t stop at new terms and policies.  As CTO now and an infrastructure engineer in the past, I’ve been focused on ensuring our platform can scale and we are appropriately staffed to handle these gnarly issues and in particular, privacy and security.  Over the last few years, we’ve built a
dedicated anti-evil team
to focus on creating engineering solutions to help curb spam and abuse.  This year, we’re working on building out our dedicated security team to ensure we’re equipped to handle and can assess threats in all forms.  We appreciate the work you all have done to
responsibly report security vulnerabilities
as you find them.
Note
: Given that there's a lot to look over in these two updates, we've decided to push the date they take effect to June 8, 2018, so you all have two full weeks to review. And again, just to be clear, there are no actual product changes or technical changes on our end.
I know it can be
difficult to stay on top of
all of these Terms of Service updates
(and what they mean for you)
, so we’ll be sticking around to answer questions in the comments.  I’m not a lawyer (though I can sense their presence for the sake of this thread...) so just remember we can’t give legal advice or interpretations.

Over the past few months, we’ve talked a lot about our desktop redesign—
why we’re doing it
,
moderation/styling tools we’re adding
, and, most recently,
how you all have shaped our designs
. Today, we’re going to try something a little different. We’d like to take all of you on a field trip,
to the Museum of Reddit
!
When we started our work on the redesign over a year ago, we looked at pretty much every launch since 2005 to see what our team could learn from studying the way new features were rolled out in the past (on Reddit
and other sites
). So, before I preview another new feature our team has been working on, I want to share some highlights from the history books, for new redditors who may not realize how much the site has changed over the years and for those of you on your 12th cake day, who have seen it all.
Trippin’ Through Time
When Reddit launched back in June of 2005, it was a different time. Destiny’s Child was breaking up, Pink Floyd was getting back together, and Reddit’s front page
looked like this
.
In the site’s early days,
u/spez
and
u/kn0thing
played around with the design in PaintShopPro 5, did the first user tests
by putting a laptop with Reddit on it in front of strangers at Starbucks
, and introduced the foundation of our desktop design, with a cleaned-up look for the front page, a handful of sorting options, and our beloved alien mascot
Snoo
.
As Reddit grew, the admins steadily rolled out changes that brought it closer to the Reddit you recognize today. (Spoiler: Many of these changes were not received well at the time...)
They launched commenting. (The first comment, fittingly, was about how
comments are going to ruin Reddit
.) They recoded the entire site
from Lisp to Python
. They added
limits on the lengths of post titles
. And in 2008, they rolled out a beta for Reddit’s biggest change to date:
user-created subreddits
.
It’s hard to imagine Reddit without subreddits now, but as a new feature, it
wasn’t without controversy
. In fact, many users felt that Reddit should be organized by tags, not communities, and
argued
passionately
against
subreddits
. (Fun fact: That same year, the admins also launched
our first desktop redesign
, which received its share of
good
,
bad
, and
constructive
reviews.)
During those early years, Reddit had an extremely small staff that spent most of their time scaling the site to keep up with our growing user base instead of launching a lot of new features. But they did start taking some of the best ideas from the community and bringing them in-house, moving Reddit Gifts from a user-run project to an official part of Reddit and turning a
cumbersome URL trick
people used to make multireddits into
a supported feature
.
That approach of looking to the community first has shaped the features we’ve built in the years since then, like
image hosting
(my first project as an admin),
video hosting
,
mobile apps
,
mobile mod tools
,
flair
,
live threads
,
spoiler tags
, and
crossposting
, to name a few.
What Did We Learn? Did We Learn Things? Let's Find Out!
Throughout all of these launches, two themes have stood out time and time again:
You all have shown us millions of creative ways to use Reddit, and our best features have been the ones that unlock more user creativity.
The best way to roll out a new feature is to get user feedback, early and often.
With the desktop redesign, we built structured styles so that anyone can give their subreddit a unique look and feel without learning to code. We revamped mod tools, taking inspiration from popular third-party tools and CSS hacks, so mods can do things like
set post requirements
and
take bulk actions
more easily. And we engineered an entirely new tech stack to allow our teams to adapt faster in response to your feedback (more on that in our next blog post about engineering!).
Previewing... Inline Images in Text Posts
One feature we recently rolled out in the redesign is our Rich Text Editor, which allows you to format your posts without markdown and, for the first time, include inline images within text posts!
Like anything we’ve built in the past, we expect our desktop redesign to evolve a lot as we bring more users in to test it, but we’re excited to see all of the creative ways you use it along the way.
In the meantime, all mods now have access to the redesign, with invites for more users coming soon. (Thank you to everyone who’s given feedback so far!) If you receive an invite in your inbox, please take a moment to play around with the redesign and let us know what you think. And if you’d like to be part of our next group of testers, subscribe to

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/pg006s/covid_denialism_and_policy_clarifications/,13946,1,COVID denialism and policy clarifications,"“Happy” Wednesday everyone
As
u/spez
mentioned in his
announcement post
last week, COVID has been hard on all of us. It will likely go down as one of the most defining periods of our generation. Many of us have lost loved ones to the virus. It has caused confusion, fear, frustration, and served to further divide us. It is my job to oversee the enforcement of our policies on the platform. I’ve never professed to be perfect at this. Our policies, and how we enforce them, evolve with time. We base these evolutions on two things: user trends and data. Last year, after we rolled out
the largest policy change in Reddit’s history
, I shared a
post
on the prevalence of hateful content on the platform. Today, many of our users are telling us that they are confused and even frustrated with our handling of COVID denial content on the platform, so it seemed like the right time for us to share some data around the topic.
Analysis of Covid Denial
We sought to answer the following questions:
How often is this content submitted?
What is the community reception?
Where are the concentration centers for this content?
Below is a chart of all of the COVID-related content that has been posted on the platform since January 1, 2020. We are using common keywords and known COVID focused communities to measure this. The volume has been relatively flat since mid last year, but since July (coinciding with the increased prevalence of the Delta variant), we have seen a sizable increase.
COVID Content Submissions
The trend is even more notable when we look at COVID-related content reported to us by users. Since August, we see approximately 2.5k reports/day vs an average of around 500 reports/day a year ago. This is approximately 2.5% of all COVID related content.
Reports on COVID Content
While this data alone does not tell us that COVID denial content on the platform is increasing, it is certainly an indicator. To help make this story more clear, we looked into potential networks of denial communities. There are some well known subreddits dedicated to discussing and challenging the policy response to COVID, and we used this as a basis to identify other similar subreddits. I’ll refer to these as “high signal subs.”
Last year, we saw that less than 1% of COVID content came from these high signal subs, today we see that it's over 3%. COVID content in these communities is around 3x more likely to be reported than in other communities (this is fairly consistent over the last year). Together with information above we can infer that there has been an increase in COVID denial content on the platform, and that increase has been more pronounced since July. While the increase is suboptimal, it is noteworthy that the large majority of the content is outside of these COVID denial subreddits. It’s also hard to put an exact number on the increase or the overall volume.
An important part of our moderation structure is the community members themselves. How are users responding to COVID-related posts? How much visibility do they have? Is there a difference in the response in these high signal subs than the rest of Reddit?
High Signal Subs
Content positively received - 48% on posts, 43% on comments
Median exposure - 119 viewers on posts, 100 viewers on comments
Median vote count - 21 on posts, 5 on comments
All Other Subs
Content positively received - 27% on posts, 41% on comments
Median exposure - 24 viewers on posts, 100 viewers on comments
Median vote count - 10 on posts, 6 on comments
This tells us that in these high signal subs, there is generally less of the critical feedback mechanism than we would expect to see in other non-denial based subreddits, which leads to content in these communities being more visible than the typical COVID post in other subreddits.
Interference Analysis
In addition to this, we have also been investigating the claims around targeted interference by some of these subreddits. While we want to be a place where people can explore unpopular views, it is never acceptable to interfere with other communities. Claims of “brigading” are common and often hard to quantify. However, in this case, we found very clear signals indicating that
r/NoNewNormal
was the source of around 80 brigades in the last 30 days (largely directed at communities with more mainstream views on COVID or location-based communities that have been discussing COVID restrictions). This behavior continued even after a warning was issued from our team to the Mods.
r/NoNewNormal
is the only subreddit in our list of high signal subs where we have identified this behavior and it is one of the largest sources of community interference we surfaced as part of this work (we will be investigating a few other unrelated subreddits as well).
Analysis into Action
We are taking several actions:
Ban
r/NoNewNormal
immediately for breaking our rules against brigading
Quarantine 54 additional COVID denial subreddits under
Rule 1
Build a new reporting feature for moderators to allow them to better provide us signal when they see community interference. It will take us a few days to get this built, and we will subsequently evaluate the usefulness of this feature.
Clarifying our Policies
We also hear the feedback that our policies are not clear around our handling of health misinformation. To address this, we wanted to provide a summary of our current approach to misinformation/disinformation in our
Content Policy
.
Our approach is broken out into (1) how we deal with health misinformation (falsifiable health related information that is disseminated regardless of intent), (2) health disinformation (falsifiable health information that is disseminated with an intent to mislead), (3) problematic subreddits that pose misinformation risks, and (4) problematic users who invade other subreddits to “debate” topics unrelated to the wants/needs of that community.
Health Misinformation. We have long interpreted our rule against posting content that “encourages” physical harm, in this
help center article
, as covering health misinformation, meaning falsifiable health information that encourages or poses a significant risk of physical harm to the reader. For example, a post pushing a verifiably false “cure” for cancer that would actually result in harm to people would violate our policies.
Health Disinformation. Our rule against impersonation, as described in this
help center article
, extends to “manipulated content presented to mislead.” We have interpreted this rule as covering health disinformation, meaning falsifiable health information that has been manipulated and presented to mislead. This includes falsified medical data and faked WHO/CDC advice.
Problematic subreddits.  We have long applied
quarantine
to communities that warrant additional scrutiny. The purpose of quarantining a community is to prevent its content from being accidentally viewed or viewed without appropriate context.
Community Interference. Also relevant to the discussion of the activities of problematic subreddits,
Rule 2
forbids users or communities from “cheating” or engaging in “content manipulation” or otherwise interfering with or disrupting Reddit communities.  We have interpreted this rule as forbidding communities from manipulating the platform, creating inauthentic conversations, and picking fights with other communities. We typically enforce Rule 2 through our anti-brigading efforts, although it is still an example of bad behavior that has led to bans of a variety of subreddits.
As I mentioned at the start, we never claim to be perfect at these things but our goal is to constantly evolve. These prevalence studies are helpful for evolving our thinking. We also need to evolve how we communicate our policy and enforcement decisions. As always, I will stick around to answer your questions and will also be joined by

Winners of the Coins Giveaway have been
announced below in the stickied comment
! Thanks to all who participated!
Hi all,
You may have noticed some new icons popping up alongside Silver, Gold, and Platinum Awards on your front page recently—these are
Community Awards
! We started testing these in a
small alpha group back in April
and expanded the group to include more volunteer communities over the past couple of weeks.
As of today, Community Awards are now widely available for mods to create in their communities.
What Are Community Awards?
Community Awards give mods the ability to create custom Awards for redditors to use in their own communities. Mods can select the images, names, and Coin price of Awards to reflect their own communities. Awards can be priced between 500 Coins and 40,000 Coins.
Community Awards will be available to give in the communities that created them, in addition to Silver, Gold, and Platinum Awards (which are available site-wide).
A highly decorated post on r/DunderMifflin, featuring Silver, Gold, and Platinum, as well as the new Community Awards!
In the above screenshot from
r/DunderMifflin
, you can see a few new icons in between Gold and Silver. These are
Community Awards
.
What Are the Benefits of Community Awards?
Community Awards are a new way of showing appreciation to posters and commenters. But unlike Silver, Gold and Platinum, when Community Awards are used, they give Coins back to that community through the
Community Bank
.
With this new update, 20% of Coins spent on Community Awards will go into a bank of Community Coins. For example, in the
r/IAmA
community if you give the “Star of Excellence” Award (2,000 Coins) to another user,
r/IAmA
automatically gets 400 Coins in its Community Bank.
Mods can access the Community Bank to give…
Mod-Exclusive Awards
Moderators will now have the ability to give Mod-Exclusive Awards, to recognize users for high-quality content that is representative of their community.
Mod-Exclusive Awards will draw from the bank of Community Coins, so Moderators don’t need to spend money to reward users (e.g., for community contests). Mod-Exclusive Awards also have the additional benefit of 1 or more months of Reddit Premium, depending on the Award price.
Mod-Award costing
1,800 Coins
=
1 month
of Reddit Premium
Mod-Award costing
5,400 Coins
=
3 months
of Reddit Premium
… and so on!
Here’s what Mod-Exclusive Awards look like on posts / comments:

Which Communities Are Eligible for Community Awards?
Community Awards are available to public, SFW, non-banned, non-quarantined communities.
Great! How Do I Go and Create Awards Now?
Check out
our companion post on r/modnews
for all the details on how mods can create Awards!
We are looking forward to seeing all your creativity with these new Awards, but
please do note these important considerations
when creating Awards:
They must comply with
Reddit’s Content Policy
;
They must not violate intellectual property rights of others; and
They must be SFW.
A Coin Giveaway: Mods, Create Some New Awards!
We've seen some pretty great Awards pop up in a few subs already, but now that they're available to more mod teams, we’re seeing which community can create the best collection of six Community Awards!
Participating is pretty simple:
If you are a mod, create an amazing set of six Community Awards that exemplifies the culture of your community, and reply to the stickied comment below with the name of your community.
For 20 random entries, we will put 40,000 Coins into to each community's Community Bank, to give back to users in your communities!",

here
. We made a commitment to you to publish an annual report, detailing government and law enforcement agency requests for private information about our users. In keeping with that promise, we’ve published our
2015 transparency report
.
We hope that sharing this information will help you better understand our
Privacy Policy
and demonstrate our commitment for Reddit to remain a place that actively encourages authentic conversation.
Our goal is to provide information about the number and types of requests for user account information and removal of content that we receive, and how often we are legally required to respond. This isn’t easy as a small company as we don’t always have the tools we need to accurately track the large volume of requests we receive. We will continue, when legally possible, to inform users before sharing user account information in response to these requests.
In 2015, we did not produce records in response to 40% of government requests, and we did not remove content in response to 79% of government requests.
In 2016, we’ve taken further steps to protect the privacy of our users. We joined our industry peers in an amicus brief
supporting Twitter
, detailing our desire to be honest about the national security requests for removal of content and the disclosure of user account information.
In addition, we joined an amicus brief
supporting Apple
in their fight against the government's attempt to force a private company to work on behalf of them. While the government asked the court to
vacate the court order
compelling Apple to assist them, we felt it was important to stand with Apple and speak out against this unprecedented move by the government, which threatens the relationship of trust between a platforms and its users, in addition to jeopardizing your privacy.
We are also excited to announce the launch of our
external law enforcement guidelines
. Beyond clarifying how Reddit works as a platform and briefly outlining how both federal and state law enforcements can compel Reddit to turn over user information, we believe they make very clear that we adhere to strict standards.
We know the success of Reddit is made possible by your trust. We hope this transparency report strengthens that trust, and is a signal to you that we care deeply about your privacy.

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/d6li3o/an_update_on_content_manipulation_and_an_upcoming/,10952,1,An Update on Content Manipulation… And an Upcoming Report,"TL;DR:
Bad actors never sleep, and we are always evolving how we identify and mitigate them. But with the upcoming election, we know you want to see more. So we're committing to a quarterly report on content manipulation and account security, with the first to be shared in October. But first, we want to share context today on the history of content manipulation efforts and how we've evolved over the years to keep the site authentic.
A brief history
The concern of content manipulation on Reddit is as old as Reddit itself. Before there were subreddits (circa 2005), everyone saw the same content and we were primarily concerned with spam and vote manipulation. As we grew in scale and introduced subreddits, we had to become more sophisticated in our detection and mitigation of these issues. The creation of subreddits also created new threats, with “brigading” becoming a more common occurrence (even if rarely defined). Today, we are not only dealing with growth hackers, bots, and your typical shitheadery, but we have to worry about more advanced threats, such as state actors interested in interfering with elections and inflaming social divisions. This represents an evolution in content manipulation, not only on Reddit, but across the internet. These advanced adversaries have resources far larger than a typical spammer. However, as with early days at Reddit, we are committed to combating this threat, while better empowering users and moderators to minimize exposure to inauthentic or manipulated content.
What we’ve done
Our strategy has been to focus on fundamentals and double down on things that have protected our platform in the past (including the
2016 election
). Influence campaigns represent an evolution in content manipulation, not something fundamentally new. This means that these campaigns are built on top of some of the same tactics as historical manipulators (certainly with their own flavor). Namely, compromised accounts, vote manipulation, and inauthentic community engagement. This is why we have hardened our protections against these types of issues on the site.
Compromised accounts
This year alone, we have taken preventative actions on over 10.6M accounts with compromised login credentials (
check yo’ self
), or accounts that have been hit by bots attempting to breach them. This is important because compromised accounts can be used to gain immediate credibility on the site, and to quickly scale up a content attack on the site (yes, even that throwaway account with password = Password! is a potential threat!).
Vote Manipulation
The purpose of our anti-cheating rules is to make it difficult for a person to unduly impact the votes on a particular piece of content. These rules, along with user downvotes (because you know bad content when you see it), are some of the most powerful protections we have to ensure that misinformation and low quality content doesn’t get much traction on Reddit. We have strengthened these protections (in ways we can’t fully share without giving away the secret sauce). As a result, we have reduced the visibility of vote manipulated content by 20% over the last 12 months.
Content Manipulation
Content manipulation is a term we use to combine things like spam, community interference, etc. We have completely overhauled how we handle these issues, including a stronger focus on proactive detection, and machine learning to help surface clusters of bad accounts. With our newer methods, we can make improvements in detection more quickly and ensure that we are more complete in taking down all accounts that are connected to any attempt. We removed over 900% more policy violating content in the first half of 2019 than the same period in 2018, and 99% of that was before it was reported by users.
User Empowerment
Outside of admin-level detection and mitigation, we recognize that a large part of what has kept the content on Reddit authentic is the users and moderators. In our
2017 transparency report
we highlighted the relatively small impact that Russian trolls had on the site. 71% of the trolls had 0 karma or less! This is a direct consequence of you all, and we want to continue to empower you to play a strong role in the Reddit ecosystem. We are investing in a safety product team that will build improved safety (user and content) features on the site. We are still staffing this up, but we hope to deliver new features soon (including Crowd Control, which we are in the process of refining thanks to the good feedback from our alpha testers). These features will start to provide users and moderators better information and control over the type of content that is seen.
What’s next
The next component of this battle is the collaborative aspect. As a consequence of the large resources available to state-backed adversaries and their nefarious goals, it is important to recognize that this fight is not one that Reddit faces alone. In combating these advanced adversaries, we will collaborate with other players in this space, including law enforcement, and other platforms. By working with these groups, we can better investigate threats as they occur  on Reddit.
Our commitment
These adversaries are more advanced than previous ones, but we are committed to ensuring that Reddit content is free from manipulation. At times, some of our efforts may seem heavy handed (forcing password resets), and other times they may be more opaque, but know that behind the scenes we are working hard on these problems. In order to provide additional transparency around our actions, we will publish a narrow scope security-report each quarter. This will focus on actions surrounding content manipulation and account security (note, it will not include any of the information on legal requests and day-to-day content policy removals, as these will continue to be released annually in our
Transparency Report
). We will get our first one out in October. If there is specific information you’d like or questions you have, let us know in the comments below.

These are the primary metrics we track internally, and we thought you’d want to see them too. If there are alternative metrics that seem worth looking at as part of this report, we’re all ears.
Content Manipulation
Content manipulation is a term we use to combine things like spam, community interference, vote manipulation, etc. This year we have overhauled how we handle these issues, and this quarter was no different. We focused these efforts on:
Improving our detection models for accounts performing these actions
Making it harder for them to spin up new accounts
Recently, we also improved our enforcement measures against accounts taking part in
vote manipulation
(i.e. when people coordinate or otherwise cheat to increase or decrease the vote scores on Reddit). Over the last 6 months (and mostly during the last couple of months), we increased our actions against accounts participating in vote manipulation by about 30x. We sanctioned or warned around 22k accounts for this in the last 3 weeks of September alone.
Account Security
This quarter, we finished up a major effort to detect all accounts that had credentials matching historical 3rd party breaches. It's important to track breaches that happen on other sites or services because bad actors will use those same username/password combinations to break into your other accounts (on the basis that a percentage of people reuse passwords). You might have experienced some of our efforts if we forced you to reset your password as a precaution. We expect the number of protective account security actions to drop drastically going forward as we no longer have a large backlog of breach datasets to process. Hopefully we have reached a steady state, which should reduce some of the pain for users. We will continue to deal with new breach sets that come in, as well as accounts that are hit by bots attempting to gain access (please take a look at
this post
on how you can improve your account security).
Our Recent Investigations
We have a lot of investigations active at any given time (courtesy of your neighborhood t-shirt spammers and VPN peddlers), and while we can’t cover them all, we want to use this report to share the results of just some of that work.
Ban Evasion
This quarter, we dealt with a highly coordinated ban evasion ring from users of
r/opieandanthony
. This began after we banned the subreddit for targeted harassment of users, as well as repeated copyright infringement. The group would quickly pop up on both new and abandoned subreddits to continue the abuse. We also learned that they were coordinating on another platform and through dedicated websites to redirect users to the latest target of their harassment.
This situation was different from your run-of-the-mill
shitheadery
ban evasion because the group was both creating new subreddits
and
resurrecting inactive or unmoderated subreddits. We quickly adjusted our efforts to this behavior. We also reported their offending account to the other platform and they were quick to ban the account. We then contacted the hosts of the independent websites to report the abuse. This helped ensure that the sites are no longer able to redirect automatically to Reddit for abuse purposes. Ultimately, we banned 78 subreddits (5 of which existed prior to the attack), and suspended 2,382 accounts. The ban evading activity has largely ceased (you know...until they read this).
There are a few takeaways from this investigation worth pulling out:
Ban evaders (and others up to no good) often work across platforms, and so it’s important for those of us in the industry to also share information when we spot these types of coordinated campaigns.
The layered moderation on Reddit works: Moderators brought this to our attention and did some awesome initial investigating; our Community team was then able to communicate with mods and users to help surface suspicious behavior; our detection teams were able to quickly detect and stop the efforts of the ban evaders.
We have also been developing and testing new tools to address ban evasion recently. This was a good opportunity to test them in the wild, and they were incredibly effective at detecting and quickly actioning many of the accounts that were responsible for the ban evasion actions. We want to roll these tools out more broadly (expect a future post around this).
Reports of Suspected Manipulation
The protests in Hong Kong have been a growing concern worldwide, and as always, conversation on Reddit reflects this. It’s no surprise that we’ve seen Hong Kong-related communities grow immensely in recent months as a result. With this growth, we have received a number of user reports and comments asking if there is manipulation in these communities. We take the authenticity of conversation on Reddit incredibly seriously, and we want to address your concerns here.
First, we have not detected widespread manipulation in Hong Kong related subreddits nor seen any manipulation that affected those communities or their conversations in a meaningful way.
It's worth taking a step back to talk about what we look for in these situations. While we obviously can’t share all of our tactics for investigating these threats, there are some signals that users will be familiar with. When trying to understand if a community is facing widespread manipulation, we will look at foundational signals such as the presence of vote manipulation, mod ban rates (because mods know their community better than we do), spam content removals, and other signals that allow us to detect coordinated and scaled activities (
pause for dramatic effect
). If this doesn’t sound like the stuff of spy novels, it’s because it’s not. We continually talk about foundational safety metrics like vote manipulation, and spam removals because these are the same tools that advanced adversaries use (For more thoughts on this look
here
).
Second, let’s look at what other major platforms have reported on coordinated behavior targeting Hong Kong. Their investigations revealed attempts consisting primarily of very low quality propaganda. This is important when looking for similar efforts on Reddit. In healthier communities like
r/hongkong
, we simply don’t see a proliferation of this low-quality content (from users or adversaries). The story does change when looking at
r/sino
or
r/Hong_Kong
(note the mod overlap). In these subreddits, we see far more low quality and one-sided content. However, this is not against our rules, and indeed it is not even particularly unusual to see one-sided viewpoints in some geographically specific subreddits...What IS against the rules is coordinated action (state sponsored or otherwise). We have looked closely at these subreddits and we have found no indicators of widespread coordination. In other words, we do see this low quality content in these subreddits, but it seems to be happening in a genuine way.
If you see anything suspicious, please report it to us
here
. If it’s regarding potential coordinated efforts that aren't as well-suited to our regular report system, you can also use our separate investigations report flow by [emailing us](mailto:
investigations@reddit.zendesk.com
).
Final Thoughts
Finally, I would like to acknowledge the reports our peers have published during the past couple of months (or even today). Whenever these reports come out, we always do our own investigation. We have not found any similar attempts on our own platform this quarter. Part of this is a recognition that Reddit today is less international than these other platforms, with the majority of users being in the US, and other English speaking countries. Additionally, our layered moderation structure (user up/down-votes, community moderation, admin policy enforcement) makes Reddit a more challenging platform to manipulate in a scaled way (i.e. Reddit is hard). Finally, Reddit is simply not well suited to being an amplification platform, nor do we aim to be. This reach is ultimately what an adversary is looking for. We continue to monitor these efforts, and are committed to being transparent about anything that we do detect.
As I mentioned above, this is the first version of these reports. We would love to hear your thoughts on it, as well as any input on what type of information you would like to see in future reports.
I’ll stick around, along with
u/worstnerd

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3tlcil/we_are_updating_our_privacy_policy_effective_jan/,10669,2089,"We are updating our Privacy Policy (effective Jan 1, 2016)","In a little over a month we’ll be updating our
Privacy Policy
. We know this is important to you, so I want to explain what has changed and why.
Keeping control in your hands is paramount to us, and this is our first consideration any time we change our privacy policy. Our overarching principle continues to be to request as little personally identifiable information as possible. To the extent that we store such information, we do not share it generally. Where there are exceptions to this, notably when you have given us explicit consent to do so, or in response to legal requests, we will spell them out clearly.
The new policy is functionally very similar to the previous one, but it’s shorter, simpler, and less repetitive. We have clarified what information we collect automatically (basically anything your browser sends us) and what we share with advertisers (nothing specific to your Reddit account).
One notable change is that we are increasing the number of days we store IP addresses from 90 to 100 so we can measure usage across an entire quarter. In addition to internal analytics, the primary reason we store IPs is to fight spam and abuse. I believe in the future we will be able to accomplish this without storing IPs at all (e.g. with hashing), but we still need to work out the details.
In addition to changes to our Privacy Policy, we are also beginning to roll out support for
Do Not Track
. Do Not Track is an option you can enable in modern browsers to notify websites that you do not wish to be tracked, and websites can interpret it however they like (most ignore it). If you have Do Not Track enabled, we will not load any third-party analytics. We will keep you informed as we develop more uses for it in the future.
Individually, you have control over what information you share with us and what your browser sends to us automatically. I encourage everyone to understand how browsers and the web work and what steps you can take to protect your own privacy. Notably, browsers allow you to disable
third-party cookies
, and you can customize your browser with a variety of privacy-related
extensions
.
We are proud that Reddit is home to many of the most open and genuine conversations online, and we know this is only made possible by your trust, without which we would not exist. We will continue to do our best to earn this trust and to respect your basic assumptions of privacy.
Thank you for reading. I’ll be here for an hour to answer questions, and I'll check back in again the week of Dec 14th before the changes take effect.

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/blev4z/how_to_keep_your_reddit_account_safe/,10229,1,How to keep your Reddit account safe,"Your account expresses your voice and your personality here on Reddit. To protect that voice, you need to protect your access to it and maintain its security. Not only do compromised accounts deprive you of your online identity, but they are often used for malicious behavior like vote manipulation, spam, fraud, or even just posting content to misrepresent the true owner. While we’re always developing ways to take faster action against compromised accounts, there are things you can do to be proactive about your account’s security.
What we do
to keep your account secure:
Actively look for suspicious signals
- We use tools that help us detect unusual behavior in accounts. We monitor trends and compare against known threats.
Check passwords against 3rd party breach datasets
- We check for username / password combinations in 3rd party breach sets.
Display your recent IP sessions for you to access
- You can check your
account activity
at any time to see your recent login IPs. Keep in mind that the geolocation of each login may not be exact and will only include events within the last 100 days. If you see something you don’t recognize, you should change your password immediately and ensure your email address is correct.
If we determine that your account is vulnerable to compromise (or has actually been compromised), we lock the account and force a password reset. If we can’t establish account ownership or the account has been used in a malicious manner that prevents it being returned to the original owner, the account may be permanently suspended and closed.
What you can do
to prevent this situation:
Use permanent emails
- We highly encourage users to link their accounts to accessible email addresses that you regularly check (you can add and update email addresses in your
user settings page
if you are using new reddit, otherwise you can do that from the
preferences page
in old reddit). This is also how you will receive any activities alerting you of suspicious activity on your account if you’re signed out. As a general rule of thumb, avoid using email addresses you don't have permanent ownership over like school or work addresses. Temporary email addresses that expire are a bad idea.
Verify your emails
- Verifying your email helps us confirm that there is a real person creating the account and that you have access to the email address given. If we determine that your account has been compromised, this is the only way we have to validate account ownership. Without this our only option will be to permanently close the account to prevent further misuse and access to the original owner’s data. There will be no appeals possible!
Check your profile occasionally to make sure your email address is current.
You can do this via the
preferences page on old reddit
or the
settings page in new reddit
. It’s easy to forget to update it when you change schools, service providers, or set up new accounts.
Use strong/unique passwords
- Use passwords that are complex and not used on any other site. We recommend using a password manager to help you generate and securely store passwords.
Add two factor authentication
- For an extra layer of security. If someone gets ahold of your username/password combo, they will not be able to log into your account without entering the verification code.
We know users want to protect their privacy and don’t always want to provide an email address to companies, so we don’t require it. However, there are certain account protections that require users establish ownership, which is why an email address is required for password reset requests. Forcing password resets on vulnerable accounts is one of many ways we try to secure potentially compromised accounts and prevent manipulation of our platform. Accounts flagged as compromised with a verified email receive a forced password reset notice, but accounts without one will be permanently closed. In the past, manual attempts to establish ownership on accounts with lost access rarely resulted in an account recovery. Because manual attempts are ineffective and time consuming for our operations teams and you, we won’t be doing them moving forward. You're welcome to use Reddit without an email address associated with your account, but do so with the understanding of the account protection limitation. You can visit your user settings page at anytime to add or verify an email address.",

I want to first address the effect my resignation will have on the community. A large part of my role as Head of Community was reflected behind the scenes (policy, community regulation etc.) and the community team is much more interactive than I on a daily basis so very little will change after my departure.
Media outlets are suggesting that the circumstances around my departure are different than they are in reality so I'd like to clear this up as I don't like being misrepresented. Since a few women have left reddit recently, certain reports have implied that my gender was the cause. That is simply not the case as I have always felt respected as a colleague here and managed to surround myself with good people in an industry not always known for that. The theory that I am leaving because of recent changes in policy is also false as I happily participated in creating those changes and stand by the decision to enforce them.
At the expense of boring you with the truth, I have made this decision to resign so that I can head home to spend time with my family. The last few years have been pretty crazy and honestly, I'm looking forward to a Christmas free of work - but still encourage you all to continue to make the
reddit gift exchange
a ground breaking experience!!! It really is that simple. It was not an easy decision to make but I know it's the right one for me right now.
So what's next? Obviously, we need someone to take on this role in my absence and it's crucial to the well-being of reddit to have a qualified person in this seat. We should have someone who knows the community inside and out, who understands the policies and practices, and who has been using the tools long enough to know what works and needs work. reddit is entirely unique and deserves to be run by people who truly understand it.
Lucky for us, we had the perfect candidate sitting right in front of us! When
/u/spez
asked if I had anyone in mind, there was only one person I thought of,
/u/krispykrackers
. Her amazing knowledge of the history of reddit, how the community works, and the cultures of individual subreddits is exactly what we need from a Head of Community. A redditor since 2008, employed by reddit for five years, and a community manager for over a year, she has been a very important part of our daily community interactions and is so dedicated to her work that I'm not sure she even sleeps!
I'm very confident that krispy and spez, along with the rest of reddit, will guide the community to the best state it has ever been in and I am excited to see the future of reddit unfold with their leadership. 
Join me in welcoming krispykrackers to her new and much deserved role of Head of Community at reddit!
Farewell, all!

creature-of-the-night
type of person? A straight-up vampire? Or just a redditor that wants to browse in night mode? Then you’ll be happy to hear: Night Mode has (finally) landed so you can read Reddit without searing your retinas (we heard it’s a thing).
We want to give you guys more choice in how you browse new Reddit, and Night Mode has been a top feature request in the
r/redesign
community, so a few months ago we set out to build it.
...Annnnd now it’s been awhile since we first announced Night Mode was coming. Turns out creating and implementing a color system to incorporate a new theme is tough. But our design and engineering teams were undaunted: dive under the hood of the Design & Engineering effort to build Night Mode on the
blog
.
To start browsing Reddit in darkness, click on your username in the upper right hand corner, and then toggle it on. If you're on old Reddit, you can visit
http://new.reddit.com/
to try out Night Mode. If you enjoy it, you can opt for it to be your default experience by selecting Opt In under Night Mode.
We hope you’ll enjoy this retina-saving feature as much as we do. But seriously jokes aside, we are continuously trying to improve Reddit for y'all and we'll post more soon. Let us know your thoughts on Night Mode.

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/bpfyx1/introducing_custom_feeds_plus_a_community_contest/,8797,1002,Introducing Custom Feeds (plus: a Community Contest with modest prizes!),"Hello hello,
We’ve made some changes to Multireddits that we’d like to share with you. Also, a fun contest! Let’s get to it...
What’s New
New Name: Multireddits → Custom Feeds
Multireddits have been around a
long time
. They are a way for redditors to curate communities into shareable feeds and can help newer redditors discover more communities. However, they haven’t been widely adopted. In order to prevent confusion, we will be changing the name from Multireddits to “Custom Feeds.” Sometimes simple is better.
More Support
We’ve added more support to new Reddit and our iOS app for Custom Feeds. Now, redditors can create a new Custom Feed, add or remove communities from them, duplicate other redditors' feeds, and change the privacy settings. Previously, this was something you could only do from old Reddit. We’ll be adding support for Custom Feeds on Android in the near future.
iOS Screenshot
New Follow Functionality
You can now follow another redditor’s Custom Feed (as long as it’s set to Public). This means that when you follow a feed it will appear on your list of Custom Feed subscriptions and when that redditor adds another community to the feed, you’ll see that update the next time you open the feed. This will be super useful for communities that want to keep a running feed of related communities, or for folks that have a specific ever-evolving interest that they want to share with others.
Follow on new Reddit
Improved Sharing
We’ve made some tweaks to the URL structure of your Custom Feed so that it’s easier to share with others. No more accidentally sharing a URL with /me/ in it that won’t work for anyone else.  We’ve also created a new privacy category for public custom feeds, Hidden, that can be accessed by anyone with the link but will not show up on your profile.
Spaces
You can now have spaces in the name of your Custom Feed.
Enough said.
Mix and Match
Follow a mix of communities and profiles.
Coming Soon
In the near future communities will be able to create Custom Feeds that are owned by the community, rather than an individual. This will also support turning the Related Communities sidebar widget into a feed. We are also going to be building ways for you to see popular and trending Custom Feeds.
The Contest
We are investing in this feature because we believe redditors are great at finding niche communities and we want more people to discover all of the unique communities that we have. Now for the
gold
part! We are holding a one-week contest for the best Custom Feeds created by redditors. The winners will receive Coins and bragging rights.
To submit your Custom Feed, reply to the top-level sticky comment with a link to your Custom Feed and the category it best fits under.
It must be public.
Please only submit one feed per category.
Here are the categories that we will award winners from:
Aww
Artist Resources
Beauty
Books & Writing
Cool Pictures (images only)
Discussion (text only)
Fashion
Food & Cooking
Health & Fitness
Music
Parenting
Quirky
Sports
Travel
Wholesome
We’ll be picking winners based on a combination of the number of followers the feed has, how many upvotes their comment entry has, and our internal voting. Winners will be announced in a follow-up post next week.
Here are some custom feeds to get you started (many of which are mine):

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7xjt6g/because_its_valentines_day_heres_a_longwinded/,8437,1791,Because it’s Valentine’s Day… here’s a long-winded blog post about moderation and community styling in the redesign!,"Hi All,
Two weeks ago, we
kicked off our blog series
to take you behind the scenes of the redesign. As I mentioned last week, we wanted to put communities first from the beginning of our redesign efforts, so today we're going to get into some of the specifics of what that actually looks like.
Fun fact: When Reddit first launched, user-created subreddits weren't even an option. In the years since the very first ones were created, our communities have shown us thousands of creative ways to use Reddit. The most important things we wanted to bring to the core Reddit experience were the creative styling and moderation tricks and tools that you all have pioneered over the years.
Without further ado, here are some of the community features we've been working to support natively in the redesign.
Features inspired by the community
Image Flair - Emojis
Giving community members a sense of identity through unique flair is critical for many subreddits. Today, many subreddits use image flair to bring out this sense of community, like
r/baseball
's team logo flair and
r/WoW
's faction icons. To make this process simpler, we’re introducing subreddit emojis. Now, every subreddit can upload emojis in the redesign, which community members can use in their post and user flair.
Submit Validation
Moderators work hard to maintain the quality of their community. With the new Post Requirements, moderators can specify certain guidelines that a post has to abide by, such as requiring flair or title length restrictions. Users will be notified prior to submitting their posts so they aren’t confused by the rules when posting in a new community, they have the opportunity to fix their errors, and so moderators can spend less time addressing posts that don't meet these guidelines.
Flair Filtering
Many subreddits use post flair to allow users to sort through different types of content in their communities.
r/personalfinance
uses flair filtering to help users search posts on specific topics like retirement and budgeting,
r/OutOfTheLoop
uses flair to filter answered and unanswered questions, and other communities have put their own unique twists on this idea. Despite the usefulness of these filters, they can be very difficult to set up through CSS. Going forward, we’ll support filtering posts by flair as a native feature in the redesign.
Sidebar
Many mod teams use the sidebar to share information and resources with their community members, from the network of wholesome subreddits listed in the sidebar of
r/WholesomeMemes
to
r/IAmA
's schedule of upcoming AMAs. Unfortunately, for most redditors, maximizing this sidebar space in creative ways isn't very easy or intuitive. As we thought about how we wanted styling to work in the redesign, we looked at some of the most common sidebar hacks that communities have already been doing for years and worked to support those natively through widgets. Right now, styling in the redesign includes
text widgets
,
button widgets
,
image widgets
,
a calendar widget
,
a related communities widget
, and
a rules widget
. But we’re not stopping there! We're going to continue to add more advanced options in the coming months.
Features inspired by 3rd-party tools
Communities themselves aren’t the only ones that have inspired us; we also had the help of some great developers that build 3rd-party tools such as Toolbox and Reddit Enhancement Suite (RES).
Toolbox:
Bulk Mod Actions
Moderating subreddits with a high volume of activity can be difficult, and next to impossible without the help of third-party tools. To make things easier, we've been working to improve our native mod tools, both in our apps and in the redesign. Instead of taking one action at a time, you can now moderate multiple posts or comments at once. You’ll also be able to switch between different community mod queues with ease.
RES:
Show All Images (aka Card View)
RES has enhanced Reddit’s expandos (i.e., embedded media like images, videos, and gifs) for years, and one of the most popular features has been “show all images” (i.e., expand all the things!). The redesign has embraced this feature with Card View, a browsing option that allows you to easily view each post’s images, videos, and text with no more effort than scrolling down the page.
RES:
User Info Cards
(inline banning/muting)
When cruising through posts and comments, redditors are only their usernames and the content they’ve posted. RES has provided a little more context by allowing you to see that user’s stats (like account age and karma score) and interact with them in context. Reddit has picked up that same idea and added even more content like avatar and bio—plus actions for moderators such as banning or muting without having to visit another page.
Toolbox:
Removal Reasons
Over the years, Toolbox has built some amazing features that have simplified moderation. As a Toolbox-inspired effort to improve our own mod tools, we’re pleased to support removal reasons as a native feature in the redesign. (Note for existing Toolbox users: Throughout our redesign process, we also worked with the toolbox team to make sure they have everything they need to make sure Toolbox features work in the redesign.)
Styling
Today it can require a lot of expertise to style a community.
Custom CSS is complicated, breaks in different places, and doesn’t work on mobile.
With more of our users shifting to mobile each year and many communities remaining unstyled because CSS is too complicated, we wanted to build a system that would give moderators a high level of customization without requiring CSS. (But don't worry: As we said before, we will also give you the option to use CSS enhancements in the redesign. This is still in development.)
With these new features, we're excited to say that
styling a community is much easier
. Some mod teams have already shown how creative you can get with structured styles, like
r/AskReddit
,
r/CasualConversation
,
r/Greenday
,
r/ITookAPicture
, and
r/NASCAR
. We're looking forward to seeing more of you test out the new styling.
Join the Redesign!
Over the next few weeks, we’ll be rolling out invitations widely for more moderators to start exploring these tools, styling their communities, and providing feedback for us to iterate on. Moderators, we know you need some time to get your communities styled before we let more users into the redesign, so keep an eye out for more updates soon in

Today, we’ll begin welcoming a small percentage of users into version 1 of our redesigned desktop site. We still have many improvements & features to ship in the coming weeks, but we’re proud of what we’ve built so far and excited to get it in the hands of more people. And if you don’t like it, you can opt out.
Our team has been hard at work redesigning our desktop site for more than a year. The main reasons
why we started this project in the first place
were to allow our engineers to build features faster and to make Reddit more welcoming. It has been a massive undertaking, but we started by
putting users and communities
first—building our designs based on feedback from moderators, longtime users, beta testers, and other redditors every step of the way.
What’s happening today?
Today, we’re beginning to give a small group of users access to the desktop redesign at random. We’re starting with a small group to test the load on our servers and plan to make the opt-in available to everyone in the coming weeks. On behalf of the team, thank you for all of your comments, posts, bug tests, conversations with our designers, creative ideas, and other feedback over the past year. We are very proud of what we have accomplished together and we are excited for you to get
your hands on it

old.reddit.com
. Furthermore, we do not have plans to do away with the current site. We want to give you more choices for how you view Reddit
we are looking at you i.reddit.com.
What’s next?
As those of you who’ve given us redesign feedback already know, Reddit can be extremely complex. That said, we have not yet rebuilt all of our current features. We’re still iterating on your feedback and building more of the features you love -- such as native nightmode and keyboard shortcuts --  plus more new features, which will arrive in the next few weeks. In the meantime, please keep the feedback coming and share your ideas for new features in the comments! It has been extremely helpful in shaping our roadmap, and we will continue building new features and making existing ones compatible in the redesign for the foreseeable future. We’ve made

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9jf8nh/revamping_the_quarantine_function/,7889,8673,Revamping the Quarantine Function,"While Reddit has had a
quarantine
function for almost three years now, we have learned in the process. Today, we are updating our quarantining policy to reflect those learnings, including adding an appeals process where none existed before.
On a platform as open and diverse as Reddit, there will sometimes be communities that, while not prohibited by the
Content Policy
, average redditors may nevertheless find highly offensive or upsetting. In other cases, communities may be dedicated to promoting hoaxes (yes we used that word) that warrant additional scrutiny, as there are some things that are either verifiable or falsifiable and not seriously up for debate (eg, the Holocaust did happen and the number of people who died is well documented). In these circumstances, Reddit administrators may apply a quarantine.
The purpose of quarantining a community is to prevent its content from being accidentally viewed by those who do not knowingly wish to do so, or viewed without appropriate context.  We’ve also learned that quarantining a community may have a positive effect on the behavior of its subscribers by publicly signaling that there is a problem. This both forces subscribers to reconsider their behavior and incentivizes moderators to make changes.
Quarantined communities display a warning that requires users to explicitly opt-in to viewing the content (similar to how the NSFW community warning works). Quarantined communities generate no revenue, do not appear in non-subscription-based feeds (eg Popular), and are not included in search or recommendations. Other restrictions, such as limits on community styling, crossposting, the share function, etc. may also be applied. Quarantined subreddits and their subscribers are still fully obliged to abide by Reddit’s
Content Policy
and remain subject to enforcement measures in cases of violation.
Moderators will be notified via modmail if their community has been placed in quarantine. To be removed from quarantine, subreddit moderators may present an appeal
here
. The appeal should include a detailed accounting of changes to community moderation practices. (Appropriate changes may vary from community to community and could include techniques such as adding more moderators, creating new rules, employing more aggressive auto-moderation tools, adjusting community styling, etc.) The appeal should also offer evidence of sustained, consistent enforcement of these changes over a period of at least one month, demonstrating meaningful reform of the community.
You can find more detailed information on the quarantine appeal and review process
here
.
This is another step in how we’re thinking about enforcement on Reddit and how we can best incentivize positive behavior.  We’ll continue to review the impact of these techniques and what’s working (or not working), so that we can assess how to continue to evolve our policies. If you have any communities you’d like to report, tell us about it
here
and we’ll review. Please note that because of the high volume of reports received we can’t individually reply to every message, but a human will review each one.

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4ny59k/lets_talk_about_orlando/,7837,10004,Let's talk about Orlando,"Hi All,
What happened in Orlando this weekend was a national tragedy. Let’s remember that first and foremost, this was a devastating and visceral human experience that many individuals and whole communities were, and continue to be, affected by. In the grand scheme of things, this is what is most important today.
I would like to address what happened on Reddit this past weekend. Many of you use Reddit as your primary source of news, and we have a duty to provide access to timely information during a crisis. This is a responsibility we take seriously.
The story broke on
r/news
, as is common. In such situations, their community is flooded with all manners of posts. Their policy includes removing duplicate posts to focus the conversation in one place, and removing speculative posts until facts are established. A few posts were removed incorrectly, which have now been restored. One moderator did cross the line with their behavior, and is no longer a part of the team. We have seen the accusations of censorship. We have investigated, and beyond the posts that are now restored, have not found evidence to support these claims.
Whether you agree with
r/news
’ policies or not, it is never acceptable to harass users or moderators. Expressing your anger is fine. Sending death threats is not. We will be taking action against users, moderators, posts, and communities that encourage such behavior.
We are working with
r/news
to understand the challenges faced and their actions taken throughout, and we will work more closely with moderators of large communities in future times of crisis. We–Reddit Inc, moderators, and users–all have a duty to ensure access to timely information is available.
In the wake of this weekend, we will be making a handful of technology and process changes:
Live threads are the best place for news to break and for the community to stay updated on the events. We are working to make this more timely, evident, and organized.
We’re introducing a change to Sticky Posts
: They’ll now be called Announcement Posts, which better captures their intended purpose; they will only be able to be created by moderators; and they must be text posts. Votes will continue to count. We are making this change to prevent the use of Sticky Posts to organize bad behavior.
We are working on a change to the
r/all
algorithm to promote more diversity in the feed, which will help provide more variety of viewpoints and prevent vote manipulation.
We are nearly fully staffed on our Community team, and will continue increasing support for moderator teams of major communities.
Again, what happened in Orlando is horrible, and above all, we need to keep things in perspective. We’ve all been set back by the events, but we will move forward together to do better next time.",

). Starting August 19 until 5PM PT, and from 9AM-5PM PT through Friday, August 23, redditors around the world will be able to create live broadcasts. In true Reddit fashion, voting will determine the top broadcast, and you can explore different broadcasts by swiping or clicking right or left. As you move further from the top broadcast, the broadcasts you see will be increasingly more random, so we encourage you to explore and vote!
First and foremost, this is about having fun as a Reddit community, and if you all enjoy it, we’ll continue to explore how it might work as an actual feature. So if you have thoughts, suggestions, or other feedback, please share that in the comments of this post. We genuinely want to hear what you all think, and we look through all of the comments we can, including those without many upvotes.
We’re rolling out the RPAN experience progressively across Reddit starting August 19, so it’s possible that some people may see RPAN earlier than others.
Some general rules for broadcasting with RPAN:
RPAN is a Safe for Work experience—Nudity, sexually suggestive content, graphic violence, illegal/dangerous behavior, hoax promotion, or content that would be seen as highly offensive/upsetting to the average redditor will result in a banned account
All redditors may see your stream, so don’t show yourself if you want to stay anonymous
Be like the Lambeosaurus—feed on pine needles and have a good time

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8830oa/and_now_a_word_from_reddits_engineers/,7738,2760,And Now a Word from Reddit’s Engineers…,"Hi all,
As you may have heard, we’ve been hard at work redesigning our desktop for the past year. In our previous four redesign blog posts,
u/Amg137
and
u/hueylewisandthesnoos
talked about
why we're redesigning
,
moderation in the redesign
,
our approach to design
, and
Reddit’s evolution
. Today, Reddit’s Engineering team invites you “under the hood” look at how we’re giving a long overdue update to Reddit’s core stack.
Spoiler: There’s going to be a fair bit of programming jargon in this post, but I promise we’ll get through it together.
History and Journey
For most of Reddit's history, the core engineering team supporting the site has been extremely small. Over its first five years, Reddit’s engineering team was comprised of just six employees. While there were some big engineering milestones in the early days—a
complete rewrite
from Lisp to Python in 2006, then
another
Python rewrite (aka “r2”) in 2008, when we introduced jQuery. Much of the code that Reddit is running on right now is code that
u/spez
wrote about ten years ago.
Given Reddit’s historically tiny eng team (at one point it was literally just
u/spladug
), our code wasn’t always ideal... But before I get into how we've gone about fixing that, I thought it'd be fun to ask some of the engineers who have been here longest to share a few highlights:
u/spladug
: ""For a while now, ‘The controller was now a giant mass of tendrils with an exciting twist’ has been the description of the r2 repository on GitHub.”
u/KeyserSosa
: ""After being gone for 5 years and having first come back, I discovered that (unsurprisingly) part of the code review process is to use ‘git blame’ to figure out who last touched some code so they can be pulled into a code review. A couple of days in, I got pinged on a code review for some JS changes that were coming because I was the last one to edit the file (one of the more core JS files we had). Keeping in mind that during most of those intervening years I had switched from being ‘full stack’ to being pretty much focused on backend/infra/data, I was somewhat surprised (and depressed) to be looking at my old JS again. I let the reviewee (a senior web dev) know that in the future that he has carte blanche to make changes to anything in JS that has my blame on it because I know for a fact that that version of me was winging it and probably didn't know what I was doing.""
u/ketralnis
: “I worked at Reddit from 2008 to 2011, then took a break and came back in 2016. When I returned my first project was to work on some performance stuff in our query caching. One piece was clearly incorrect in a way that had me concerned that the damage had spread elsewhere. I looked up who wrote it so I could go ask them what the deal was... and it was me.”
Luckily, Reddit's engineering team has grown
a lot
since those days, with most of that growth in the past two years. At our team’s current size, we're finally able to execute on a lot of the ideas you’ve given us over the years for fixes, moderation improvements (like mod mode, bulk mod actions and removal reasons), and new features (like inline images in text posts and submit validation). But even with a larger team, our ancient code base has made it extremely difficult to do this quickly and effectively.
Enter the redesign, the latest and most challenging rewrite of Reddit’s desktop code to date.
Designing Engineering Networks that Neutralize Inevitable Snags
Two years ago, engineers at Reddit had to work on complicated UI templated code, which was written in two different languages (Javascript on the client and Python on the server). The lack of separation of the frontend and backend code made it really hard to develop new features, as it took several days to even set up a developer environment. The old code base had a lot of inheritance pattern, which meant that small changes had a large impact and we spent much more time pushing those changes than we wanted to. For example, once it took us about a month to push a simple comments flat list change due to the complexity of our code base and the fact that the changes had to work well with CSS in certain communities, which we didn’t want to outright break.
When we set out to rewrite our code to solve these problems, we wanted to make sure we weren't just fixing small, isolated issues but creating a new, more modern frontend stack that allowed our engineering team to be nimble—with a componentized architecture and the scalability necessary to handle Reddit’s 330 million monthly users.
But above all, we wanted to use the rewrite as an opportunity to increase ""developer velocity,"" or the amount of time it takes an engineer to ship a fix or new feature. No more ""git blame"" for decade-old code. Just a giant mass of tendrils, shipping faster than ever.
The New Tech Stack
These are the three main components we use in the redesign today:
React is a Javascript library designed around the concept of reusable components. The components-based approach scaled well as we were hiring and our teams grew. React also supports server side rendering, which was a key requirement for us.
Redux is a predictable state container for JS apps. It greatly simplifies state management and has good performance.
TypeScript is a language that functions as a superset of Javascript. It reduces type-related bugs, has good built-in tooling, and allows for easier onboarding of new devs. (You can read more about why we chose TypeScript in
this post
by
u/nr4madas.)
Just the Beginning
With our new tech stack, we were able to ship a basic rewrite of our desktop site by September of last year. We’ve built a ton of features since then, addressing feedback we’ve gotten from a steadily growing number of users (well,
a
mostly
steady number...
). So far, we’ve shipped over 150 features, we've fixed over 1,400 bugs, and we're moving forward at a rate of ~20 features and 200+ bugs per month.
We know we still have work to do as Reddit has a very long tail of features. Fortunately, our team is already working on the majority of the most requested items (like nightmode and keyboard shortcuts), so you can expect a lot more updates from our team as more users begin to see the redesign—and because of our engineers’ work rewriting our stack over the past year, now we can ship these updates faster and more efficiently.
Over the past few weeks, we have given all moderators and beta users access to the redesign. Next week we plan to begin adding more users to make sure we can support a bigger user base on our new codebase. Users will have the option to keep the current design as their default if they wish—we do not want to force the redesign on anyone who doesn’t want to use it.
Thank you
to everyone who’s helped test, reported bugs, and given feedback on the redesign so far; all of this helps a lot.
PS:
We’re still hiring.

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4ch0pv/updates_to_our_media_previews/,7366,1064,Updates to our media previews,"What is a media preview?
On Reddit, a media preview is an image, video, or gallery in a
link post
that can be expanded with a button and viewed directly on listings and comments pages without having to leave Reddit.  Right now, we have media previews for certain types of videos, image galleries and sound files.  Media previews are controlled by
buttons that look like this
.
That’s wonderful, but what have you actually changed?
Auto-Expanded Media Previews on Comment Pages
By default if there is a preview for a link, we will expand it on comments pages and show the comments below.
Like this
.  Since the discussion generally revolves around the media content, auto-expanding will save many users a click.
New Media Preferences
You can control how media previews display on your screen with
new preferences
available on your
preferences page
.
Media previews support more file types
We’ve updated media previews to show content from more file types, most notably direct image links.  Put simply, if you submit a link post to to Reddit with a URL that ends in
.jpg
,
.png
, etc., that media will be expandable.  Put even simply-er, more content on Reddit will have a preview available.
NSFW Flows
Since media previews are expanded by default on comments pages, we’ve also added an
optional screen to block NSFW media
. This will let you more quickly choose whether or not to see NSFW media.
TL;DR:
Media previews auto-expand on comments pages
New user preferences to control media previews
More media previews!

A big thank you to all the users in
r/beta
that helped test this feature and provided valuable feedback throughout the development process.",

transparency report
. In an effort to continue moving forward, we are changing how we respond to legal takedowns. In 2014, the vast majority of the
content reddit removed was for copyright and trademark reasons
, and 2015 is shaping up to be no different.
Previously, when we removed content, we had to remove
everything
: link or self text, comments, all of it. When that happened, you might have come across a comments page that had nothing more than
this, surprised and censored Snoo
.
There would be no reason, no information, just a surprised, censored Snoo. Not even a ""discuss this on reddit,"" which is rather un-reddit-like.
Today, this changes.
Effective immediately,
we're replacing the use of censored Snoo and moving to an approach that lets us preserve content that hasn't specifically been legally removed (like comment threads), and clearly identifies that we, as reddit, INC, removed the content in question.
Let us pretend we have this post I made on reddit, suspiciously titled ""Test post, please ignore"", as seen
in its original state here
, featuring one of my cats. Additionally, there is a comment on that post which is the first paragraph of this post.
Should we receive a
valid DMCA request
for this content and deem it legally actionable, rather than being greeted with censored Snoo and no other relevant information, visitors to the post instead will now see
a message stating that we, as admins of reddit.com, removed the content and a brief reason why
.
A more detailed, although still abridged, version of the notice will be posted to
/r/ChillingEffects
, and a sister post submitted to chillingeffects.org.
You can view an example of a removed post and comment
here
.
We hope these changes will provide more value to the community and provide as little interruption as possible when we receive these requests. We are committed to being as transparent as possible and empowering our users with more information.
Finally, as this is a relatively major change, we'll be posting a variation of this post to multiple subreddits. Apologies if you see this announcement in a couple different shapes and sizes.

Reddit is the home to the most amazing content creators on the internet. Together, we create a place for artists, writers, scientists, gif-makers, and countless others to express themselves and to share their work and wisdom. They fill our days with beautiful photos, witty poems, thoughtful AMAs, shitty watercolours, and scary stories. Today, we make it easier for them to connect directly to you.
Reddit is testing a new profile experience that allows a handful of users, content creators, and brands to post directly to their profile, rather than to a community. You’ll be able to follow them and engage with them there. We’re excited because having this new ability will give our content contributors a home for their voice on Reddit. This feature will be available to everyone as soon as we iron out the kinks.
What does it look like?
Check-out
u/Shitty_Watercolour
’s new profile page:
http://www.reddit.com/user/shitty_watercolour
where he’s doing an AMA.
Reddit co-founder
u/kn0thing
is also participating as an alpha user: you gotta eat your own dogfood:

Riot Games is participating under
u/LeagueOfLegends
where they will be engaging their fans with AMAs and patch feedback threads:
http://www.reddit.com/user/leagueoflegends
On our mobile apps, you can search for “shitty_watercolour”, “kn0thing”, “leagueoflegends” and you’ll see them as
u/shitty_watercolour
,
u/kn0thing
,
u/leagueoflegends
(

)
What is it?
A new profile page experience that allows you to follow other redditors
Selected redditors will be able to post directly to their profile
We worked with some moderators to pick a handful of redditors to test this feature and will slowly roll this out to more users over the next few months
Who is this for?
We want to build this feature for all users but we’re starting with a small group of alpha testers.
How does it work?
You will start to see some user profile pages with new designs (e.g.
u/Shitty_Watercolour
,
u/kn0thing
,
u/LeagueOfLegends
).
If you like what they post, you can start to follow them, much as you subscribe to communities. This does not impact our “friends” feature.
You can comment on their profile posts
Once you follow a user, their profile posts will start to show up  on your front-page. Posts they make in communities will only show up on your frontpage if you subscribe to that community.
What’s next?
We’re taking feedback on this experience on
r/beta
and will be paying close attention to the voices of community members. We want to understand what the impact of this change is to Reddit’s existing communities, which is why we’re partnering with only a handful of users as we slowly roll this out.
We’ll ramp up the number of testers to this program based on feedback from the community (see application sections below)
How do I participate?
If you want to participate as a beta user please fill out this
survey
.
If you want to nominate a fellow redditor, please use this
survey
.
TL;DR:
We’re testing a new profile page experience with a few Redditors (alpha testers). They’ll be able to post to their profile and you’ll be to follow them. Send us bugs or feedback specific to the feature on in
r/beta
!
u/hidehidehidden
Q&A:
Q: Why restrict this to just a few users?
A: This is an early release (“alpha”) product and we want to make sure everything is working optimally before rolling it out to more users. We picked most of our initial testers from the gaming space so we can work closely with a core group of mods that can provide direct feedback to us.
Q: Who are the initial testers and how were they selected?
A: We reached out to the moderators of a few communities and the testers were recommended to us based on the quality of their content and engagement. The testers include video makers, e-sports journalists, commentators, and a game developer.
Q: When will this roll out to everyone?
A: If all goes well, over the course of the next few months. We want to do this roll-out carefully to avoid any disruptions to existing communities. This is a major product launch for Reddit and we’re looking to the community to give us their input throughout this process.
Q: What about pseudo-anonymity?
A: Users can still be pseudonymous when posting to their profile. There’s no obligation for a user to reveal their identity. Some redditors choose not to be pseudonymous, in the case of some AMA participants, and that’s ok too.
Q: How will brands participate in this program?
A: During this alpha stage of the rollout, our testers are users, moderators, longtime redditors, and organizations that have a strong understanding of Reddit and a history of positive engagement. They are selected based on how well how they engage with redditors and there is no financial aspect to our initial partnerships. We are only working with companies that understand Reddit and want to engage our users authentic conversations and not use it as another promotional platform.
We’re specifically testing this with Riot Games because of how well they participate in
r/LeagueOfLegends
and demonstrated a deep understanding of how we expect companies to engage on Reddit. Their interactions in the past have been honest, thoughtful, and collaborative. We believe their direct participation will add more great discussions to Reddit and demonstrate a new better way for brands and companies to converse with their fans.
Q: What kinds of users will be allowed to create these kinds of profiles? Is this product limited to high-profile individuals and companies?
A: Our goal is to make this feature accessible to everyone in the Reddit community. The ability to post to profile and build a following is intended to enhance the experience of Reddit users everywhere — therefore, we want the community to provide feedback on how the launch is implemented. This product can’t succeed without being useful for redditors of every type.  We will reach out to you for feedback in the
r/beta
community as we grow and test this new product.
Q: Will this change take away conversations and subscribers from existing communities?
A: We believe the value of the Reddit experience comes from two different but related places: engaging in communities and engaging with people. Providing a platform for content creators to more easily post and engage on Reddit should spur more interesting conversations everywhere, not just within their profile. We’re also testing a new feature called “Active in these Communities” on the tester’s profile page to encourage redditors to discover and engage with more communities.
Q: Are you worried about giving individual users too much power on Reddit?
A: This is one reason that we’re being so careful about how we’re testing this feature — we want to make sure no single user becomes so powerful that it overpowers the conversation on Reddit. We will specifically look to the community for feedback in
r/beta
as the product develops and we onboard more users.
Q: The new profile interface looks very similar to the communities interface, what’s the difference between the two?
A: Communities are the interest hubs of Reddit, where passionate redditors congregate around a subject area or hobby they share a particular interest in. Content posted to a profile page is the voice of a single user.
Q: What about the existing “friends” feature?
A: We’re not making any changes to the existing “friends” feature or
r/friends
.
Q: Will Reddit prevent users with a history of harassment from creating one of these profiles?
A: Content policy violations will likely impact a user's ability to create an updated profile page and use the feature. We don’t want this new platform to be used as a vehicle for harassment or hate.
Q: I’m really opposed to the idea and I think you should reconsider. What if you’re wrong?
A: We don’t have all of the answers right now and that’s why we’re testing this with a small group of alpha users. As with any test, we’re going to learn a lot along the way. We may find that our initial hypothesis is wrong or you may be pleasantly surprised. We won’t know until we try and put this front of our users. Either way, the alpha product you see today will evolve and change based on feedback.
Q: How do I participate in this beta?
A:  We’ll be directly reaching out to redditors we think will be a great fit. We’re also taking direct applications via this
survey
or you can nominate a fellow redditor via this
survey

/r/programming
and
/r/science
to more niche communities like
/r/redditlaqueristas
and
/r/goats
. Nearly all of that has come from intrepid individuals who create and moderate this vast network of communities. I know, because I was reddit’s first ""community manager"" back when we had just one (
/r/reddit.com

In creating hundreds of thousands of communities over this decade, you’ve learned a lot along the way, and we have, too; we’re rolling out improvements to help you create the next 9,000 active communities and beyond!
Check Out the First Mod Tutorial Today!
We’ve started a series of mod tutorials
, which will help anyone from experienced moderators to total neophytes learn how to most effectively use our tools (which we’re always improving) to moderate and grow the best community they can. Moderators can feel overwhelmed by the tasks involved in setting up and building a community. These tutorials should help reduce that learning curve, letting mods learn from those who have been there and done that.
New Team & New Hires
Jessica (

We’re working through new policies to help you all create the most open and wide-reaching platform we can. We’re especially excited about building more mod tools to let software do the hard stuff when it comes to moderating your particular community. We’re striving to build the robots that will give you more time to spend engaging with your community --
spend more time discussing the virtues of cooking with spam
, not dealing with spam in your subreddit.
Protecting Your Digital Privacy
Last year, we missed a chance to be a leader in social media when it comes to protecting your privacy -- something we’ve cared deeply about since reddit’s inception. At our recent all hands company meeting, this was something that we all, as a company, decided we needed to address.
No matter who you are, if a photograph, video, or digital image of you in a state of nudity, sexual excitement, or engaged in any act of sexual conduct, is posted or linked to on reddit without your permission, it is prohibited on reddit. We also recognize that violent personalized images are a form of harassment that we do not tolerate and we will remove them when notified.
As usual, the revised Privacy Policy will go into effect in two weeks, on March 10, 2015
.
We’re so proud to be leading the way among our peers when it comes to your digital privacy and consider this to be one more step in the right direction.
We’ll share how often these takedowns occur in our yearly privacy report.
We made reddit to be the world’s best platform for communities to be informed about whatever interests them. We’re learning together as we go, and today’s changes are going to help grow reddit for the next ten years and beyond.
We’re so grateful and excited to have you join us on this journey.

As we have mentioned
in
different
places
, we have a team focused on the detection and investigation of content manipulation on Reddit. Content manipulation can take many forms, from traditional spam and upvote manipulation to more advanced, and harder to detect, foreign influence campaigns. It also includes nuanced forms of manipulation such as subreddit sabotage, where communities actively attempt to harm the experience of other Reddit users.
To increase transparency around how we’re tackling all these various threats, we’re rolling out a new subreddit for security and safety related announcements (
r/redditsecurity
). The idea with this subreddit is to start doing more frequent, lightweight posts to keep the community informed of the actions we are taking. We will be working on the appropriate cadence and level of detail, but the primary goal is to make sure the community always feels informed about relevant events.
Over the past 18 months, we have been building an operations team that partners human investigators with data scientists (also human…). The data scientists use advanced analytics to detect suspicious account behavior and vulnerable accounts. Our threat analysts work to understand trends both on and offsite, and to investigate the issues detected by the data scientists.
Last year, we also implemented a Reliable Reporter system, and we continue to expand that program’s scope. This includes working very closely with users who investigate suspicious behavior on a volunteer basis, and playing a more active role in communities that are focused on surfacing malicious accounts. Additionally, we have improved our working relationship with industry peers to catch issues that are likely to pop up across platforms. These efforts are taking place on top of the work being done by our users (
reports
and downvotes), moderators (doing a lot of the heavy lifting!), and internal admin work.
While our efforts have been driven by rooting out information operations, as a byproduct we have been able to do a better job detecting traditional issues like spam, vote manipulation, compromised accounts, etc. Since the beginning of July, we have taken some form of action on over 13M accounts. The vast majority of these actions are things like forcing password resets on accounts that were vulnerable to being taken over by attackers due to breaches outside of Reddit (please don’t reuse passwords,
check your email address
, and consider setting up
2FA
) and banning simple spam accounts. By improving our detection and mitigation of routine issues on the site, we make Reddit inherently more secure against more advanced content manipulation.
We know there is still a lot of work to be done, but we hope you’ve noticed the progress we have made thus far. Marrying data science, threat intelligence, and traditional operations has proven to be very helpful in our work to scalably detect issues on Reddit. We will continue to apply this model to a broader set of abuse issues on the site (and keep you informed with further posts). As always, if you see anything concerning, please feel free to report it to us at

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4mv578/affiliate_links_on_reddit/,5670,2773,Affiliate links on Reddit,"Hi everyone,
Today we’re launching a test to rewrite links (in both comments and posts) to automatically include an affiliate URL crediting Reddit with the referral to approximately five thousand merchants (Amazon won’t be included). This will only happen in cases where an existing affiliate link is not already in place. Only a small percentage of users will experience this during the test phase, and all affected redditors will be able to opt out via a setting in user preferences labelled “replace all affiliate links”.
The redirect will be inserted by JavaScript when the user clicks the link. The link displayed on hover will match the original link. Clicking will forward users through a third-party service called Viglink which will be responsible for rewriting the URL to its final destination. We’ve signed a contract with them that explicitly states they won't store user data or cookies during this process.
We’re structuring this as a test so we can better evaluate the opportunity. There are a variety of ways we can improve this feature, but we want to learn if it’s worth our time. It’s important that Reddit become a sustainable business so that we may continue to exist. To that end, we will explore a variety of monetization opportunities. Not everything will work, and we appreciate your understanding while we experiment.
Thanks for your support.
Cheers,
u/starfishjenga
Some FAQs:
Will this work with my adblocker?
Yes, we specifically tested for this case and it should work fine.
Are the outgoing links HTTPS?
Yes.
Why are you using a third party instead of just implementing it yourselves?
Integrating five thousand merchants across multiple countries is non-trivial. Using Viglink allowed us to integrate a much larger number of merchants than we would have been able to do ourselves.
Can I switch this off for my subreddit?
Not right now, but we will be discussing this with subreddit mods who are significantly affected before a wider rollout.
Will this change be reflected in the site FAQ?
Yes, this will be completed shortly.
This is available
here
EDIT (additional FAQ): Will the opt out be for links I post, or links I view?
When you opt out, neither content you post nor content you view will be affiliatized.
EDIT (additional FAQ 2): What will this look like in practice?
If I post a link to
a storm trooper necklace
and don't opt out or include an affiliate link then when you click this link, it will be rewritten so that you're redirected through Viglink and Reddit gets an affiliate credit for any purchase made.
EDIT 3
We've added some questions about this feature to the
FAQ
EDIT 4
For those asking about the ability to opt out - based on your feedback we'll make the opt out available to everyone (not just those in the test group), so that if the feature rolls out more widely then you'll already be opted out
provided you have changed the user setting
. This will go live later today.
EDIT 5
The user preference has been added for
all
users. If you do not want to participate, go ahead and uncheck the box in your user preferences labeled ""replace affiliate links"" and content you create or view will not have affiliate links added.
EDIT (additional FAQ 3): Can I get an ELI5?
When you click on a link to some (~5k) online stores, Reddit will get a percentage of the revenue of any purchase. If you don't like this, you can opt out via the user preference labeled ""replace affiliate links"".
EDIT (additional FAQ 4): The name of the user preference is confusing, can you change it?
Feedback taken, thanks. The preference will be changed to ""change links into Reddit affiliate links"". I'll update the text above when the change rolls out. Thanks!
EDIT (additional FAQ 5): What will happen to existing affiliate links?

Today, the US House Judiciary Committee has a hearing on the
Stop Online Piracy Act
or SOPA. The text of the bill is
here
. This bill would strengthen copyright holders' means to go after allegedly infringing sites at detrimental cost to the freedom and integrity of the Internet. As a result, we are joining forces with organizations such as the EFF, Mozilla, Wikimedia, and the FSF for
American Censorship Day
.
Part of this act would undermine the
safe harbor
provisions of the
Digital Millenium Copyright Act
which would make sites like reddit and YouTube liable for hosting user content that may be infringing. This act would also force search engines, DNS providers, and payment processors to cease all activities with allegedly infringing sites, in effect, walling off users from them.
This bill sets a chilling precedent that endangers everyone's right to freely express themselves and the future of the Internet. If you would like to voice your opinion to those in Washington, please consider

That’s Wookie for “Hello again, hope you’re doing well, AMAE (ask me anything engineering), aaarrhhuu-uhh”,
I’m back to chat
as promised

Here’s a few updates:
I’m still

(glue is drying AS WE TYPE)
Yes, Zach Weiner (
/u/MrWeiner
) is one my brothers.  I believe he’d agree that I am the superior sibling in that my name comes earlier in the alphabet.
Q4 planning at Reddit is underway.  Engineering will likely be focusing on 7 key areas, with the theme of getting engineering onto a solid foundation:
Hiring strong engineers like mad
Reducing stress on the team by prioritizing work that reduces chances of downtime and false alarms
Building some much needed moderator and community tools (currently working to prioritize which ones)
Performing a major overhaul of our age old code base and architecture so that we can create new product faster, better, and more enjoyably
Shipping killer iOS and Android apps
Continue building a badass data pipeline and data science platform
Improving our ads system significantly (improving auction model, targeting, and billing)
These goals will likely take all of Q4 and quite possibly all of Q1, especially the overhaul.  Code cleanups of this size take a
long
time to reach 100% done (in my experience), but we do hope to get to “escape velocity” — meaning that the code is in a much better place that allows us to move faster building new products/tools and onboarding new engineers, while doing incremental cleanup forevermore.
Keep the PMs coming!  Been getting awesome feedback (positive and negative) and super strong resumes.  The super duper highest priority hiring needs are iOS / Android, Infra / Ops, Data Eng, and Full Stack.  Everything else is merely ""super highest priority"".
Finally, yes, it’s true.  I am running for President of the United States.  My platform will focus on more video games and less cilantro.
I have about 1.17 hours now to answer questions, and then I'm going and playing with my wee ones.
Edit: Running to my train.  If I can get a seat, I'll finish off some in-flight answers.  XOXOXO, Marty",

Mobile web users will be redirected to a new compact view on m.reddit.com starting today
Hi everyone!
Over the past few months, we have worked hard to improve the Reddit experience on mobile devices with the launch of native mobile apps and a new mobile web experience. We launched a mobile web beta a little while back and thanks to the community involved, we were able to make improvements for an official launch today. Starting today, users on mobile web will be directed to m.reddit.com instead of
www.reddit.com
.
Easy way to opt out:
If you prefer to stick with
www.reddit.com
, there is a very easy way to opt out. All you have to do is click the menu button in the top right corner and select ‘Desktop Site’. The next time you come back, you will be served the desktop site by default.
Here
is a short gif that demonstrates how to opt out.
What’s next?
Please give it a try and post any feedback you have — we'd love to hear how we can make it better. This is just the beginning of making the mobile web experience as seamless as possible for all of you.",

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/434h6c/reddit_in_2016/,4129,5436,Reddit in 2016,"Hi All,
Now that 2015 is in the books, it’s a good time to reflect on where we are and where we are going. Since I returned last summer, my goal has been to bring a sense of calm; to rebuild our relationship with our users and moderators; and to improve the fundamentals of our business so that we can focus on making you (our users), those that work here, and the world in general, proud of Reddit. Reddit’s mission is to help people discover places where they can be themselves and to empower the community to flourish.
2015 was a big year for Reddit. First off, we cleaned up many of our external policies including our Content Policy, Privacy Policy, and API terms. We also established internal policies for managing requests from law enforcement and governments. Prior to my return,
Reddit took an industry-changing stance on involuntary pornography
.
Reddit is a collection of communities, and the moderators play a critical role shepherding these communities. It is our job to help them do this. We have shipped a
number of improvements
to these tools, and while we have a long way to go, I am happy to see steady progress.
Spam and abuse threaten Reddit’s communities. We created a Trust and Safety team to focus on abuse at scale, which has the added benefit of freeing up our Community team to focus on the positive aspects of our communities. We are still in transition, but you should feel the impact of the change more as we progress. We know we have a lot to do here.
I believe we have positioned ourselves to have a strong 2016. A phrase we will be using a lot around here is ""Look Forward."" Reddit has a long history, and it’s important to focus on the future to ensure we live up to our potential. Whether you access it from your desktop, a mobile browser, or a native app, we will work to make the Reddit product more engaging. Mobile in particular continues to be a priority for us. Our new Android app is going into beta today, and our new iOS app should follow it out soon.
We receive many requests from law enforcement and governments. We take our stewardship of your data seriously, and we know transparency is important to you, which is why we are putting together a Transparency Report. This will be available in March.
This year will see a lot of changes on Reddit. Recently we built an A/B testing system, which allows us to test changes to individual features scientifically, and we are excited to put it through its paces. Some changes will be big, others small and, inevitably, not everything will work, but all our efforts are towards making Reddit better. We are all redditors, and we are all driven to understand why Reddit works for some people, but not for others; which changes are working, and what effect they have; and to get into a rhythm of constant improvement. We appreciate your patience while we modernize Reddit.
As always, Reddit would not exist without you, our community, so thank you. We are all excited about what 2016 has in store for us.
–Steve
edit: I'm off. Thanks for the feedback and questions. We've got a lot to deliver on this year, but the whole team is excited for what's in store. We've brought on a bunch of new people lately, but our biggest need is still hiring. If you're interested, please check out

announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/231hl7/we_recommend_that_you_change_your_reddit_password/,4099,3753,We recommend that you change your reddit password,"Greetings all,
As you may have heard, reddit quickly patched its SSL endpoints against server attack of the infamous heartbleed vulnerability. However, the heartbleed vulnerability has been around for quite some time, and up until it was publicly disclosed reddit's SSL endpoints were vulnerable.
Additionally, our application was found to have a client-side vulnerability to heartbleed which allowed memory to be leaked to external servers. We quickly addressed this after it was reported to us. Exploiting this vulnerability required the use of a specific API call on reddit, and we have analyzed our logs and found nothing to suggest that this API call was being exploited en masse. However, the vulnerability did exist.
Given these two circumstances, it is recommended that you
change your reddit password
as a precaution. Updating your password will log you out of all other reddit.com sessions. We also recommend that you make use of a unique,
strong
password on any site you use. The most common way accounts on reddit get broken into is by attackers exploiting
password reuse
.
It is also strongly recommended, though not required, that you set an email address on your reddit account. If you were to ever forget your password, we cannot contact you to reset it if we don't have your email address. We do not sell or otherwise make your email address available to third-parties, as indicated in our
privacy policy
.
Stay safe out there.

Edit:
A few people indicated that they had changed their passwords recently and wanted to know if they're now safe.  We addressed the server issue hours after it was disclosed on April 7th. The client-side leak was disclosed and addressed on April 9th. Our old certs were revoked by the 9th (all dates in PDT). If you have changed your password since April 9th, you're AOK.",
announcements,https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/,3999,17998,Content Policy Update,"Today we are releasing an update to our
Content Policy
. Our goal was to consolidate the various rules and policies that have accumulated over the years into a single set of guidelines we can point to.
Thank you to all of you who provided feedback throughout this process. Your thoughts and opinions were invaluable. This is not the last time our policies will change, of course. They will continue to evolve along with Reddit itself.
Our policies are not changing dramatically from what we have had in the past. One new concept is Quarantining a community, which entails applying a set of restrictions to a community so its content will only be viewable to those who explicitly opt in. We will Quarantine communities whose content would be considered extremely offensive to the average redditor.
Today, in addition to applying Quarantines, we are banning a handful of communities that exist solely to annoy other redditors, prevent us from improving Reddit, and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else. Our most important policy over the last ten years has been to allow just about anything so long as it does not prevent others from enjoying Reddit for what it is: the best place online to have truly authentic conversations.
I believe these policies strike the right balance.
update: I know some of you are upset because we banned
anything
today, but the fact of the matter is we spend a disproportionate amount of time dealing with a handful of communities, which prevents us from working on things for the other 99.98% (literally) of Reddit. I'm off for now, thanks for your feedback. RIP my inbox.",

There are two ways to participate in the beta program:
If you're
logged in
to your reddit account, you can opt-in as a beta tester in your
preferences

If you're
logged out
, you can visit
beta.reddit.com
to see beta features. Note: you may end up back on
www.reddit.com
if you click on a link to reddit from somewhere else, like email or Twitter.
More details on the beta program, including how to give feedback on beta features, are on
this wiki page
. Please note that not every feature will go to beta before launching - some changes may not need extensive beta testing, and we will continue to release some new features to
reddit gold
members first. The best way to find out what's currently in beta testing is to check out

introduce themselves to the newcomers and get a good back-and-forth
going. This way, the latter can ask questions about the site and the former
can detail the precise way they'd like those darn kids to stay off their

It's been a while since there's been one of these, so we thought we'd kick
one off today.
Some ideas to get everyone started:
What makes reddit special?
What are some cool aspects of the site that might not be immediately obvious to new users? Which of the default settings should be changed ASAP?
What are your favorite reddit communities?
What about reddit do you find ugly or annoying or buggy? Do you have workarounds? Perhaps a GreaseMonkey script or Stylish module?

Black lives matter.,"As the gap of the political divide in our world grows deeper, we would like to take a few minutes of your time or express our support of equal treatment, equal justice, to express solidarity with groups which have been marginalized for too long, and to outright say black lives matter. The AskReddit moderators have decided to disable posting for
8 minutes and 46 seconds
— the time George Floyd was held down by police — and we will lock comments on front page posts. Our hope is that people reading this will take a moment to pause and reflect on what can be done to improve the world.
This will take place at 8PM CDT.
AskReddit is a discussion forum with which we want to encourage discussion of a wide range of topics. Now, more than ever, it’s important to talk about the topics that divide us and use AskReddit to approach these conversations with open minds and respectful discussion.
This is also an important opportunity to reiterate our stance on moderation. Simply put, we believe it’s our duty to ensure neutral and fair moderation so people with opposing views can use our platform as a place to have these important and much needed discussions about their views, our hope being that the world will benefit as a result. We feel that it is our duty to make sure that AskReddit is welcoming to all. To that end, we have a set of rules to ensure posts encourage discussion and to ensure users feel safe, welcome, and respected. As always, blatant statements of racism or any other kind of bigotry
will not be tolerated
. We want users to be able to express themselves and their views. Remember that everyone here and everyone you see in the news are human beings, too.
With all of that in mind, we reiterate our encouragement for people to discuss these hard, and often uncomfortable, topics as a way to find alignment, unity, and to progress as a society.
We ask that you take a few minutes to research a charity that aligns with your beliefs or a cause you care about and that you donate to it if you’re able.

A lot of feedback. We’ve all seen the “how would you feel about ____” in which the OP is just posting what is considered a ""shower thought"" which is aimed to ask users to support a largely popular concept in a way that fits AskReddit’s rules. Interesting and engaging titles are always great but these posts don’t have much discussion value, which is the purpose of this sub. Because of this, and due to the feedback we’ve received, we’ve decided to remove these posts moving forward.
We do understand that there’s some nuance to this. Some posts are shower thoughts/ideas, and others are actual discussion questions.
For example:
“
How would you feel about a ’if you accidentally scroll to the top, you can go back to where you were,’ button for Reddit?
” is really just a feature suggestion.
“
How would you feel about dating someone that makes a lot more money than you?
” is a discussion question.
Our philosophy in AskReddit is to keep rules as objective as possible because it helps ensure fairness and consistency in moderation without allowing for a moderator's personal discretion to interfere in the practice of removing or approving content. However, we also recognize that blanket bans on the phrasing of a question does not always accurately work to meet the spirit of the rules. If you feel your ”How would you feel” post promotes elaborate discussion and is not a rhetorical idea or limiting question, feel free to modmail us a link and we’ll be happy to manually review.
Thank you to the users who modmailed us feedback asking for this policy. We always appreciate constructive feedback and we do take every bit of feedback into consideration. If you or anyone you know has been diagnosed with mesoth...sorry, wrong script...if you have feedback for us, we always appreciate it as we want to give people the best experience in AskReddit.
With love,

india,https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f9outu/fuck_all_religion/,19494,4101,Fuck all Religion,"Fuck all religion. Fuck Hindusim, fuck Islam, fuck Christianity, fuck Buddhism. Fuck you all for believing in this made up bullshit called Religion. You know what I think about your religions? I think it is a waste of time, I think it is just another fairytale for childish adults who cant grasp the concept of death. They all want to just believe in something good after death. Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing. Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova.
You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But what matter itself, is being part of this universe.
But, you are here in the now. You are existing in this world where time passes and the universe is larger than anything you can fathom. So why do you keep insisting on believing in man made stories. There is No God, there is no rebirth, there is no heaven or hell. But there is this universe, where we all exist. Religion has brought us nothing but hardship and mass murder on a scale that would make the Spanish flu look like a minor common cold. Just take a step back and look at the past and see the countless lives that were lost because religion asked to do so. None of your religions are without blood in your hands. All of your religions have committed brutal acts of mass murder. And none of your religions have been able to answere any of the basic questions to life death or reincarnation.
False prophet and make believe deities, is what religion is.
Let go of these childish beliefs people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your destiny. Believe in the humanity of people, have faith on people. We are all part of this speck of dust, flying through the universe.  What determines our immortality is not what you did for your religion, but what you did for the future of this little speck of dust flying through the universe. Your legacy should and always be the betterment of mankind.
A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa. We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries,  we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 °C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. But this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the Stone age.
Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.

The whole argument from their side is BS.
They finally accepted that Wolf Gupta is imaginary. Why didn't they accept this earlier?
Check the document, and see for yourself all their hollow claims. The link at the end.
I am looking for lawyers. Got a lot of numbers. Talking to them right now.
One good lawyer suggested I back out, sign an apology and end it, said will cost you 30k rupees only, and that's it.
I won't back out. (Although my parents still don't know what mess I have indulged myself into. But I feel I will be able to handle them.)
Why did WhiteHatJr take this risky step? Like it seems like it won't go in their favor in public. Yet they took this desperate step. Because they know what I know and they want me to stop sharing it out there in public. Their lawsuit is to get interim junction and make me stop showing it to everyone. And even try to take down all my videos/posts/Reddit everything.
In the past 9 days, I tried if some big publication would write about it. But no one did. (Apart from one, Thanks to
Morning Context
and Ashish K Mishra for the article).
So what is it that they are trying to bury so hard?
This spreadsheet, the LIST of all the videos/tweets/links/posts/LinkedIn/Facebook/IG/ quora/Reddit/(9gag also) they reported and took down. The list contains over 700 such links. (If I included the comments of the parents that they were removing, the list would be over 2k)
Here is the List: Download, find these people, and tell them what happened to their posts. If your content was also taken down find it here: 
<As per court orders I have removed the link>
There is more. The whole company reeks of lies and deceit. Once I said I will find out who Wolf Gupta and who all these fictitious kids are. Now that the media is silent, here is the birth story of such kids and their 'apps'. And you tell me if I was wrong when I called this company a FRAUD.
<removed after Delhi HC orders on 24/11/2020 >
Neither the kids existed, nor the apps. And they really created a $300 million company around it.
If that is now fraud what it? Now I think now you can understand why the threats, why this case, why they are talking so much risk but not looking at their own mistakes. This proof was shared with one journalist but they ignored it. Now you can understand why the media was silent.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now, what do I do here?
I have three options.
Back out. Apologize and move on. Which I won't.
Hire a normal lawyer on my own and they would drag this case and make me exhausted.
As seen in many tweets today, many of you asked me to start a fund and where all can chip in and hire the best lawyer possible.
Please write in the comments which option should be taken. If option #3, please quote how much can you contribute for real, also suggest to me how to start a fundraiser and what platforms are good for it. WhiteHatJr has already spent 25 lakhs on preparing this case. So legal fights are costly. I alone can only go to a point until my pockets are empty.
Thanks

Some requests:
PLEASE don't suggest me to contact Xyz, it takes time. Each email needs to be written accordingly. I would REALLY appreciate if you write emails to different journalist/YouTubers on my behalf. I am already running out of time. A lot has to be in the next few hours.
Some one please cross-post this in different subreddutts.
WRITE about this issue. Let's not wait for the media. I have posted most of the proofs on youtube and my Twitter. Please write blogs etc about this. Can someone also try to post this issue on LinkedIn, I am banned from there.
Share etc do all that. You see how to spread this news now. Make a small poster kind of thing, those seem to work better than such long texts.
I might not be able to reply to comments and DMs today, please don't mind.
Thanks again
Pradeep Poonia.

india,https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nboonh/what_is_actually_happening_in_nepal/,11479,650,What is Actually Happening in Nepal ?? Misinformation by Indian Media.,"Hello to my fellow neighbors in India.
I am a
Nepali citizen
living near the border, connected to both our countries not only geographically but also culturally. That is why I feel it is my duty to share the truth with you about what is really happening here.
You may have seen headlines claiming that Nepal is facing
“mass protests led by Gen Z against social media ban.”
That is only a half-truth.
Here is the real sequence of events:
Three days ago, the Nepal government suddenly banned 26 social media platforms including Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, YouTube, and Reddit.
They claimed it was about registration and taxes. But these companies are already registered and paying taxes. The real motive is censorship: giving the government power to control online information, delete posts critical of them within 24 hours, and jail those who speak up.
In the next two days, criticism exploded across the country. A date was set—September 8—for nationwide protests. But it was never just about social media. That ban was only the spark.
Our patience had already run out.
Soon, the “
Nepo Babies
” trend erupted in Nepal. It exposed the lavish lifestyles of politicians’ children—designer (clothes,bags, watches, attire )worth lakhs, luxury cars, million-rupee homes, weekly international flights, and even private jets—while ordinary Nepalis struggle daily for survival. Our PM has a salary less than 65k INR but what is owns is in million of $$$.
This hit a nerve.
 Because Nepal has been under one form of tyranny or another for decades. From monarchy to so-called democracy, corruption and instability have never left us. Not a single prime minister has completed a full term in over 20 years.
[The protests were organized in the name of Gen Z, but they welcomed everyone. We were not just protesting a social media ban. We were standing against corruption, nepotism, tyranny, suppression, and decades of betrayal. In a country of just 30 million people, every single day around 5,000 youths leave to work abroad because there are no jobs, no decent pay, and no basic livelihood at home.]
And then the tragedy struck. Today, during the protest, I witnessed & carried something I will never forget. A 15-year-old schoolboy, still in uniform, was shot in the head by security forces—acting on orders from a minister. He was not the only one. Reports say more than 20 people have been killed, thousands injured, and the true numbers are being hidden.
I came home with blood still on my hands, only to see Indian news channels spinning a completely false narrative. They claimed it was all about social media and mocked our youths as being “
addicted
” to it. That angered me, but it didn’t surprise me. I know how the media can twist things.
That is why I am writing this here, to let you know the truth from the ground.

I suspected these to be gunshots as, well you know. I messaged my group chat about it and they said they heard the same things. Some guy said **** Market (a very populous place where I go, like, on a daily basis) was destroyed. Even rn I dont know if he was lying or not, but who knows. I ran upstairs and told my family about all this and we went up to the roof to see what was happening. Oh man, I have never felt anything like I felt then. Whole ass missiles were flying. We quickly turned off all the lights and went to my room, where we are still sitting. Light had gone for a long time and we were constantly looking at news on my pc. And turns out I was lucky. Although I live in one of the most major parts of Jammu, there was not much damage here. According to the Descriptions of my other friends' situations in the group chat, they supposedly had it a lot worse. Right around 9 PM, light came back and most of the people in my neighborhood have turned on their lights (I find that to be dumb). These have the longest hours of my life, and im just telling u half of the story. Much more happened in my house but its kinda personal so I cant say here. Anyways im still very worried because this is definitely not the end of the war or worse, there can be more attacks even tonight. They struck army airport, hospital, which was thankfully intercepted by the Indian Airforce. so they clearly have a very bad plan in their mind (Pakistan). Anyways I wish yall peace.
EDIT: So it is 2:15 right now and I heard sirens. Shit. But theyre gone now they were only playing for a few minutes
EDIT 2: It has been 18 days since I made this post. Thankfully me and my family are safe. This was a pretty crazy experience though. I cannot be grateful enough for the love and support yall gave me.",
india,https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/qo1ol8/i_am_sophie_zhang_fb_whistleblower_when_i_found/,9468,536,"I am Sophie Zhang, FB whistleblower. When I found fake accounts manipulating Indian politics, FB approved their removal - until they discovered that some of them were being ran by a sitting MP. The Lok Sabha is considering asking me to testify, but Reddit gets to go first. Ask me anything.","Hi,
r/india
I'm Sophie Zhang. At Facebook, I worked in my spare time at Facebook to stop major political figures/parties and world governments from using the platform to deceive their own citizenry - a deeply exhausting task that I've compared to trying to empty the ocean with a colander. When I was fired in September 2020, I stayed up until 8am in the morning to write a 7,800 word internal memo that was
leaked to the press against my objections.
I testified privately
to the INGE committee of the European Parliament in October 2020 even though I was refusing all public appearances, because they asked and my duty to democracy came first. I
went public with the Guardian
in April of this year because the problems of social media will never be solved unless directly confronted. Three weeks ago, I
testified before the British Parliament.
​
I worked across dozens of countries to protect civic discourse - ranging from Argentina to Albania, from India to Iraq, and more. The most pressing of my discoveries occurred when I personally caught the national governments of
Honduras
and
Azerbaijan
using fake assets to exploit and mislead their own citizenry on massive scales. I was also deeply concerned with Albania, where
an apparent state-sponsored network associated with the ruling Socialist Party
was similarly misleading Albanian citizens, but was unable to resolve the investigation before my departure.
In India during late 2019 and early 2020, I found an eventual total of five separate networks of fake accounts across the political spectrum supporting the INC (2), AAP (1), and BJP (2.) The pro-AAP network was acting to manipulate discourse in the Delhi 2020 elections, a fact that was very concerning to myself. Although Delhi is a local state of India, it has a population comparable to small countries such as Taiwan (fortunately I live in the U.S. and aren't in danger from saying this.) I was able to have four out of the five networks taken down (2 pro-INC network, 1 pro-AAP, and 1 pro-BJP.) FB employees approved the takedown of the fifth network, one supporting the BJP, but everything suddenly went silent
after we discovered they were connected to the account of the benefiting MP (meaning that someone with access to the MP's personal account was almost certainly running the fake accounts.)
​
My disclosures of these events have led to
considerable
recent
interest in India
, including
a call by the Internet Freedom Foundation
for myself and Frances Haugen to testify before the Lok Sabha. I arranged this AMA when I was being impatient and took the silence from the Lok Sabha to indicate that they were uninterested in calling me to testify. Since then, MP Shashi Tharoor, the Chairman of the Standing Committee on IT, has
publicly announced
that the committee is seeking approval from the Speaker to allow my testimony.
​
Separate from this,
I have also written an article on autolikers
, which are common in the Global South (including India.) Many Indians sign up for what appear to be free likes, not realizing that by doing so they have given over their credentials to shady middlemen where they may eventually be sold to e.g. an IT cell.
​
Because it often results in confusion, I want to be clear that I worked on fake accounts and inauthentic behavior - an issue that is separate from misinformation/fake news/etc. Misinformation depends solely on your words; if you write ""Cats and dogs are the same species"", it doesn't matter who you are: it's still misinformation. In contrast, inauthenticity depends solely on the user; if I dispatch 1000 fake accounts onto Reddit to comment ""Cats are adorable"", the words don't matter - it's still inauthentic behavior. If Reddit takes the fake accounts down, they're correct to do so no matter how much I yell ""they're censoring cute cats!""
​
There are genuine questions regarding how to respond to misinformation and hate speech while protecting freedom of speech. But no one serious defends the right of a politician to set up a network of inauthentic accounts supporting himself. Stopping this is necessary to protect freedom of speech, not a violation of those principles - just as stopping ballot stuffing is necessary to protect the sanctity of the ballot and the right to vote.
​
If you're interested in other things I've done, I've also written
a guide to whistleblowing
, and an op-ed arguing that the
United States is too worried about Russian social media interference
. If you have personal questions about my life,
there's a profile of me in MIT Technology Review.
​
Please ask me anything.  I might not be able to answer every question, but if so, I'll do my best to explain why I can't.

On 15th January when the pickup person came, he for the 1st time opened the box in-front of me and when he did the box was containing a defected and old PS3 instead of a Playstation 5 which I ordered. Due to which they didn’t pick up the order. I have to chat with them numerous time after which they scheduled a pickup and after the pickup was done yesterday I got to know that they have put a hold on the refund because according to them they shipped the right item & are not refunding my money. Even though I have provided them with pictures from the date of delivery & pickup along with the delivery guy opening the box for the 1st time.
I am adding all the pictures I have from the date of delivery to the date the delivery guy came to pick it up & opened it for me.
Now they are saying they cannot promise me my refund.
PS : My only fault is that I panicked seeing the box and didn’t open it right then and waited for the delivery guy (the fraud) to come and open it for me.

The day of the dinner, my mom and I cooked some food to bring. I texted my friend a heads up that I was on my way to theirs. They replied saying that the dinner location was changed to a different friend’s house in the next city over, about 20 miles away.
I started driving towards the city and asked for the address. They said everyone was already there and that there wasn’t enough room for me. I tried following up but didn’t hear anything else from them afterwards, and I didn’t want to make a scene by texting other people that were there, as most were friend-adjacent for me.
I cut my losses, turned around and went home. I got an apology text a couple of days afterwards, but felt like the rug got pulled from under me. Super frustrating situation all around.

""Pop"" treated everyone with respect and was quite popular as a result. Years after the war he received this illustrated book from one of his prisoners in the mail.
I found it rummaging through my in-law's basement this past weekend and wanted to share what I perceived to be a good primary source of history with the community. In light of the ""on all sides"" rhetoric I found this to be a poignant reminder of how people on opposing sides (literally, Hitler) could come together.
I never had a chance to meet Pop, but from what I'm told he was a gentleman and a scholar who was even more popular with the ladies than he was with the Nazis.
Here is the book:

*Edit: Many of you have asked about what type of person ""Pop"" was so I wanted to share some anecdotes from his granddaughter (my fiance):
He deeply cared about the happiness of other people and always put them before himself.
He was a Lifemaster of Bridge.
He loved getting mail so much he would sign up for mailers and then gave the gifts away.
He was always honest and told you exactly how he felt, but was nice about it.
He constantly made new friends throughout his life and was a popular gentleman.
He died in 2004 at the age of 83 after a long battle with cancer.",

Children began to be the tyrants, not the slaves, of their households.

paraphrasing of Hellenic attitudes towards the youth in 600 - 300 BC
“[Young people] are high-minded because they have not yet been humbled by life, nor have they experienced the force of circumstances.
...
They think they know everything, and are always quite sure about it.”
Rhetoric, Aristotle
4th Century BC
“The beardless youth… does not foresee what is useful, squandering his money.”

In all things I yearn for the past. Modern fashions seem to keep on growing more and more debased. I find that even among the splendid pieces of furniture built by our master cabinetmakers, those in the old forms are the most pleasing. And as for writing letters, surviving scraps from the past reveal how superb the phrasing used to be. The ordinary spoken language has also steadily coarsened. People used to say
""raise the carriage shafts""
or
""trim the lamp wick,""
but people today say
""raise it""
or
""trim it.""
When they should say,
""Let the men of the palace staff stand forth!""
they say,
""Torches! Let's have some light!""
Instead of calling the place where the lectures on the Sutra of the Golden Light are delivered before the emperor
""the Hall of the Imperial Lecture,

""the Lecture Hall,""

“Whither are the manly vigour and athletic appearance of our forefathers flown? Can these be their legitimate heirs? Surely, no; a race of effeminate, self-admiring, emaciated fribbles can never have descended in a direct line from the heroes of Potiers and Agincourt...”
Letter in Town and Country magazine republished in Paris Fashion: A Cultural History
1771
The total neglect of this art [speaking] has been productive of the worst consequences...in the conduct of all affairs ecclesiastical and civil, in church, in parliament, courts of justice...the wretched state of elocution is apparent to persons of any discernment and taste… if something is not done to stop this growing evil …English is  likely to become a mere jargon, which every one may pronounce as he pleases.
A General Dictionary of the English Language, Thomas Sheridan
1780
The free access which many young people have to romances, novels, and plays has poisoned the mind and corrupted the morals of many a promising youth; and prevented others from improving their minds in useful knowledge. Parents take care to feed their children with wholesome diet; and yet how unconcerned about the provision for the mind, whether they are furnished with salutary food, or with trash, chaff, or poison?
Memoirs of the Bloomsgrove Family, Reverend Enos Hitchcock
1790
We remarked with pain that the indecent foreign dance called the Waltz was introduced (we believe for the first time) at the English court on Friday last … it is quite sufficient to cast one's eyes on the voluptuous intertwining of the limbs and close compressor on the bodies in their dance, to see that it is indeed far removed from the modest reserve which has hitherto been considered distinctive of English females. So long as this obscene display was confined to prostitutes and adulteresses, we did not think it deserving of notice; but now that it is attempted to be forced on the respectable classes of society by the civil examples of their superiors, we feel it a duty to warn every parent against exposing his daughter to so fatal a contagion.

...a fearful multitude of untutored savages... [boys] with dogs at their heels and other evidence of dissolute habits...[girls who] drive coal-carts, ride astride upon horses, drink, swear, fight, smoke, whistle, and care for nobody...the morals of children are tenfold worse than formerly.
Anthony Ashley Cooper, the 7th Earl of Shaftesbury, Speech to the House of Commons
February 28, 1843
... see the simpering little beau of ten gallanting home the little coquette of eight, each so full of self-conceit and admiration of their own dear self, as to have but little to spare for any one else... and confess that the sight is both ridiculous and distressing... the sweet simplicity and artlessness of childhood, which renders a true child so interesting, are gone (like the bloom of the peach rudely nipped off) never to return.
""Children And Children's Parties"", published in The Mothers' Journal and Family Visitant, S.B.S.
1853

“Degeneracy of Stature”, The National Era, Thrace Talmon
December 18, 1856
A pernicious excitement to learn and play chess has spread all over the country, and numerous clubs for practicing this game have been formed in cities and villages...chess is a mere amusement of a very inferior character, which robs the mind of valuable time that might be devoted to nobler acquirements, while it affords no benefit whatever to the body. Chess has acquired a high reputation as being a means to discipline the mind, but persons engaged in sedentary occupations should never practice this cheerless game; they require out-door exercises--not this sort of mental gladiatorship.
Scientific American
July, 1858
A mendacious umbrella is a sign of great moral degradation. Hypocrisy naturally shelters itself below a silk; while the fast youth goes to visit his religious friends armed with the decent and reputable gingham. May it not be said of the bearers of these inappropriate umbrellas that they go about the streets ""with a lie in their right hand""?
“The Philosophy of Umbrellas”, Robert Louis Stevenson
1894
“
‘We want to get married, but there is nowhere we can set up a house of our own. It is either a case of waiting goodness knows how long, and we've waited all the war, or, going to live with Mary's mother.’
How often is a similar remark heard in those days, for it is the problem that young people all over the country have to face. Thousands of young fellows have come home from the war intent on setting up a home with the girl of their heart only to find that there are no homes to be had… Many men, of course, have not waited for houses, but have got married and gone into rooms or to live with relatives, but neither course can be considered very satisfactory.”
Nowhere to Set Up House, Dundee Courier
1920
Never has youth been exposed to such dangers of both perversion and arrest as in our own land and day. Increasing urban life with its temptations, prematurities, sedentary occupations, and passive stimuli just when an active life is most needed, early emancipation and a lessening sense for both duty and discipline, the haste to know and do all befitting man's estate before its time, the mad rush for sudden wealth and the reckless fashions set by its gilded youth--all these lack some of the regulatives they still have in older lands with more conservative conditions.
The Psychology of Adolescence, Granville Stanley Hall
1904
“We defy anyone who goes about with his eyes open to deny that there is, as never before, an attitude on the part of young folk which is best described as grossly thoughtless, rude, and utterly selfish.”
The Conduct of Young People, Hull Daily Mail
1925
...[The screen artists'] beauty, their exquisite clothing, their lax habits and low moral standards, are becoming unconsciously appropriated by the plastic minds of American youth. Let them do what they may; divorce scandals, hotel episodes, free love, all are passed over and condoned by the young... The eye-gate is the widest and most easily accessible of all the avenues of the soul; whatever is portrayed on the screen is imprinted indelibly upon the nation's soul.
The Pentecostal Evangel
November 6, 1926
The bad manners of all parliaments, the general tendency to connive at a rather shady business transaction if it promises to bring in money without work, jazz and Negro dances as the spiritual outlet in all circles of society, women painted like prostitutes, the efforts of writers to win popularity by ridiculing...the correctness of well-bred people, and the bad taste shown even by the nobility and old princely families in throwing off every kind of social restraint and time-honoured custom: all of these go to prove that it is now the vulgar mob that gives the tone.
Hour of Decision, Oswald Spengler (translated by C.F. Atkinson, 1942)
1933
“The Chairman alluding to the problem of young people and their English said his experience was that many did not seem able to express or convey to other people what they meant. They could not put their meaning into words, and found the same difficulty when it came to writing.”
Unable to Express Thoughts: Failing of Modern Young People, Gloucester Citizen
1936
“Probably there is no period in history in which young people have given such emphatic utterance to a tendency to reject that which is old and to wish for that which is new.”
Young People Drinking More, Portsmouth Evening News
1936
“Cinemas and motor cars were blamed for a flagging interest among young people in present-day politics by ex-Provost JK Rutherford… [He] said he had been told by people in different political parties that it was almost impossible to get an audience for political meetings. There were, of course, many distractions such as the cinema…”
Young People and Politics, Kirkintilloch Herald
1938
“Parents themselves were often the cause of many difficulties. They frequently failed in their obvious duty to teach self-control and discipline to their own children.”
Problems of Young People, Leeds Mercury
1938
“…in youth clubs were young people who would not take part in boxing, wrestling or similar exercises which did not appeal to them. The
‘tough guy’
of the films made some appeal but when it came to something that led to physical strain or risk they would not take it.”
Young People Who Spend Too Much, Dundee Evening Telegraph
1945
“How to bring young people into membership of the Church was a pressing problem raised at a meeting… Sunday School teachers in the audience had found that children were apt to leave Sunday School when they had completed their day school education. They were not following on into the church.”
Why Do Young People Neglect Religion?, Shield Daily News
1947
“It’s an irony, but so many of us are a cautious, nervous, conservative crew that some of the elders who five years ago feared that we might come trooping home full of foreign radical ideas are now afraid that the opposite might be too true, and that we could be lacking some of the old American gambling spirit and enterprise.”
The Care and Handling of a Heritage: One of the “scared-rabbit” generation reassures wild-eyed elders about future, Life
1950
“Many [young people] were so pampered nowadays that they had forgotten that there was such a thing as walking, and they made automatically for the buses… unless they did something, the future for walking was very poor indeed.”
Scottish Rights of Way: More Young People Should Use Them, Falkirk Herald
1951
“A few [35-year-old friends] just now are leaving their parents’ nest. Many friends are getting married or having a baby for the first time. They aren’t switching occupations, because they have finally landed a ‘meaningful’ career – perhaps after a decade of hopscotching jobs in search of an identity. They’re doing the kinds of things our society used to expect from 25-year-olds.”
Not Ready for Middle Age at 35, Wall Street Journal
1984
“What really distinguishes this generation from those before it is that it's the first generation in American history to live so well and complain so bitterly about it.”
The Boring Twenties, Washington Post
1993
“The traditional yearning for a benevolent employer who can provide a job for life also seems to be on the wane… In particular, they want to avoid
‘low-level jobs that aren’t keeping them intellectually challenged.’
”
Meet Generation X, Financial Times
1995
“They have trouble making decisions. They would rather hike in the Himalayas than climb a corporate ladder. They have few heroes, no anthems, no style to call their own. They crave entertainment, but their attention span is as short as one zap of a TV dial.”
Proceeding with Caution, Time
2001
And one more reflection:
“He felt that the people who were giving that kind of charge, that sweeping condemnation, were generally out of touch with the young people…
‘I think that if we knew the boys and girls — and I am thinking particularly tonight the young people of Britain — of those modern times, we should feel that after all they are very much like ourselves. They think very much like ourselves only their expression of their thinking is a little bit different.’
”
Modern Young People: ‘A Glorious Lot’, Cornishman
1934
Notes:
when the young are to be silent before
their elders; how they are to show respect to them by standing and
making them sit; what honour is due to parents; what garments or shoes
are to be worn; the mode of dressing the hair; deportment and manners
in general.
And though
only the best of them will be appointed by their predecessors, still
they will be unworthy to hold their fathers' places, and when they
come into power as guardians, they will soon be found to fall in taking
care of us, the Muses, first by under-valuing music; which neglect
will soon extend to gymnastic; and hence the young men of your State
will be less cultivated.

His trial in Israel was attended by journalists from major newspapers worldwide and tapes of the coverage were flown daily to the United States where they were made available for broadcast nationally. Eichmann was not found guilty of all charges, but enough of the most severe charges were deemed sufficient to sentence him to death by hanging. Eichmann’s defense team appealed to the Supreme Court, but the appeal was unsuccessful. They then appealed to the president of Israel for clemency. Clemency was actually considered, especially after an emotional appeal from Eichmann’s wife and brothers and many well-respected Jewish statesmen, but ultimately denied. Eichmann was finally hanged on June 1 1962; the hanging itself was witnessed by journalists.
Through these proceedings Eichmann first claimed that he was not at all involved; then, when it was proven conclusively that he was, he insisted that he was just following orders and while he had been present at mass executions he did not arrange them personally. Eichmann’s defense team focused on questioning the admissibility of evidence, for which they were largely successful (hence his not being convicted on all charges).
At no time did Eichmann, his attorneys in their testimony, or his wife or brothers in their appeals, even attempt to suggest that the Holocaust was a hoax.
Think about that. Even if you believe that the entire trial was a sham designed to railroad an innocent man, even if you think that his entire (German and non-Jewish) defense team conspired against him, Eichmann was placed in front of hundreds of reporters and television cameras every day of a four month long trial, and never once did he turn to them and say “the so-called Holocaust never happened and I’m a totally innocent Argentinian,” even though (if there was any validity to his claim) that would have been the simplest way of preventing his own execution. Do you think he was brainwashed somehow into believing he had facilitated the deaths of millions while under arrest and interrogation? They would have also had to somehow brainwash his wife and his brothers, none of whom attempted a “there was no Holocaust” defense in their clemency letters.
In other words, to believe the Holocaust is a hoax is to believe in a conspiracy that involves some combination of all of Israel, a German defense team, hundreds of newspaper reporters from all over the world, a man’s wife and family, and the man himself, all of whom could have publicly denied the Holocaust for millions of newspaper readers and television viewers and chose not to, knowing it would lead to an innocent man’s death.

Hi my name is Bob Ballard. I’m a retired U.S. Navy officer and a National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence. Besides finding the sunken R.M.S. Titanic, I’ve also discovered the German battleship Bismarck, and a number of contemporary and ancient shipwrecks around the world. I’ve conducted more than 150 deep-sea expeditions using advanced exploration technology.

history,https://old.reddit.com/r/history/comments/142p78c/rhistory_will_be_joining_the_blackout_from_june/,20817,239,r/history will be joining the blackout from June 12-14 to protest the proposed API changes which will end 3rd party apps.,"This Subreddit will be going private June 12-14. Don't Let Reddit Kill 3rd Party Apps!
What's going on?
A recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app
permanently inaccessible
to users.
On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from
Apollo
to
Reddit is Fun
to
Narwhal
to
BaconReader
to
Boost
.
Even if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface. 
This isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free.
What's the plan?
On June 12th,
many subreddits
will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away
permanently
unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because
we love Reddit
, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.
The two-day blackout isn't the
goal
, and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action.
What can
you
do?
Complain.
Message the mods of
/r/reddit.com
, who are the admins of the site: message
/u/reddit
: submit a
support request
: comment in relevant threads on
/r/reddit
, such as
this one
, leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app- and sign your username in support to this post.
Spread the word.
Rabble-rouse on related subreddits. Meme it up, make it spicy. Bitch about it to your cat. Suggest anyone you know who moderates a subreddit join us at our sister sub at
/r/ModCoord
- but please don't pester mods you
don't
know by simply spamming their modmail.
Boycott
and
spread the word...to Reddit's competition!
Stay off Reddit entirely on June 12th through the 13th- instead, take to your favorite
non
-Reddit platform of choice and make some noise in support!
Don't be a jerk.
As upsetting this may be, threats, profanity and vandalism will be worse than useless in getting people on our side. Please make every effort to be as restrained, polite, reasonable and law-abiding as possible.
How does this impact
r/history
?
Even if you only use the official Reddit app and/or ""New Reddit"" on desktop, this change still impacts all of us.
r/history
uses third party apps and browser extensions for its moderation. Even though I mostly use
r/toolbox
for my moderation, I have to use it through a special browser on my mobile to get it to work properly.
We believe that people who wish to use this subreddit in the way that's most accessible to them. We've also had several comments from people who are short sighted or even completely blind who cannot use the reddit mobile app to browse Reddit and require the use of third party apps. It's unfair for them to have to suffer.
We hope this gets the message across to Reddit. We love this Reddit and I love this sub. I want to spend as long as I can beating down unofficial versions of history and making sure that big history has a suitable place to operate from for many years to come.

I’m totally fascinated (if that’s the right word) by how the holocaust was actually allowed to happen and doing what i can to educate myself further because now I realize just how far the hate was able to spread.

(attachment in post)","My father (1919-2007) was a London-born, Dutch national, part of the World War II Dutch Underground/Resistance Movement and a German Concentration Camp survivor.  He was held captive in Krakow, Bergen-Belsen, before finally being liberated from Auschwitz by the Allied forces. Losing the majority of his family and friends in the camps, he spent most of life trying to forget his experiences, and then, spent the latter years of his life trying to remember them.
He passed away 10 years ago, leaving behind his historical fiction manuscript.  He wasn’t a writer and was not educated past high school due to the war starting; nevertheless, he was smart and hard-working and spent the better part of a decade working on it in the 1980s.

It's about his personal experiences and the personal stories of those he was friends with in the resistance and the concentration camps as told through the eyes of a fictional young, talented Dutch footballer who crosses paths with his pre-war German football rival several years into the War.  The protagonist finds that his rival, now a vindictive and powerful Nazi Commandant, is in-charge of the very Concentration Camp the young Dutchman was sent to, but his arrival there was hardly a coincidence: the German is intent on cruel revenge and the Dutchman must escape or suffer a fate worse than death. It’s a story of true accounts and real people channelled through a fictional story of a personal rivalry between two sporting heroes turned prisoner/captor.
While the first four chapters serve only to start introductions to the various lead characters and begin to establish their motivations, the plot (which really begins when the protagonist becomes imprisoned in a concentration camp) is a tale of jealously, revenge and clever escape with themes that include youthful exuberance, love, conspiracy, world sports, Hitler, political intrigue, revenge, torture and deceit; all set in a global climate of rising Fascism, intolerance and corrupt officials.
This manuscript is easy-to-read, compelling, and tells an exciting story. Even though I was only 12 years old when he completed it, I know the manuscript generated quite a bit of interest in Hollywood for a few years around the time he completed it, and that Willem Dafoe (actor) and Mervyn LeRoy (director) were personally championing the project, but partly due to LeRoy's untimely death, it was never made into a film.  That was thirty years ago.
My wife and I have spent time trying to get it published on our own, but as a reserved and shy couple that doesn’t spend much time “online,” our results have been mostly lacklustre.  But, we still believe that it can get published traditionally as my father had wished. While this is rather uncomfortable for us, we decided to see if social media can help bring us closer to the right people.
Linked is a pdf

with the first 4 chapters of the manuscript to find an interested publisher for this book. We're not sure how many unpublished books-of-quality there are by actual Holocaust Survivors left in the world, so we decided to start sharing my father's work with kind people via Reddit, hopeful that a good person can help get his story out there.

The Myth
In movies or historical documentaries, we’ve seen it time and time again. Two armies meet for the final time and soldiers of both sides, disregarding any sense of self-preservation,
suicidally charge
into each other and intermingle with the enemy soldiers. Such chaos ensues that it
looks like a giant mosh pit at a rave
in which it’s impossible to
tell friend from foe
, but somehow, the people still know who to strike. They engage in
individual duels all over the field
.
When we think about it, we might ask:
„How did medieval soldiers tell friend from foe in battle?“ A very common question both on Reddit and Quora. Others might ask how did the frontline soldiers deal with the fact that they’re basically going to die – because standing in the frontline means certain death, right? That’s how it’s depicted in the movies, right? Battles were chaotic, it had to be like that! Right?
As Jonathan Frakes would put it: No way. Not this time. It’s false. It’s totally made up. It’s fiction. We made it up. It’s a total fabrication. Not this time. It’s false. It’s a myth.
It’s a bad movie trope.
Why the trope doesn’t make sense
Humans, in general, are usually not very keen on dying or getting themselves seriously injured or crippled. We all wish to return back unscathed to our homes, families and friends. This is called
self-preservation
.
Why would medieval soldiers behave differently than any other human being?
The point is, if you run into a crowd of armed people with no regards to your safety, you die without any contribution to the battle-effort. And no one wants to die like that.
By running out of your crowd towards the enemy crowd, you lose all defensive advantages which being in a crowd provides. You will not only have enemies in front of you but everywhere around you. When that happens, it’s all over. That’s just it. Hypothetically, all your buddies could do it all at once and get as far as the fourth rank, but that will only lead to more wasteful death. This is no way to wage a battle! You don’t need to
experience it
to know it’s bullshit. Nor you need to be a trained veteran to know it’s a suicide. It’s
a common sense
. Yes, it might have looked good once in
Braveheart
25 years ago, but when I see it in a modern TV show like
Vikings
or in a movie like
Troy
or
The King(2019)
, it robs me of the pleasure watching it and I’d genuinely love to see it done the right way for once. If Total War games can get it almost right, why can’t the movies?
The point is, if you stay in your crowd, keeping your enemy only in front of you, while being surrounded by your friends from left, right and behind, your chances of survival increase. It is no coincidence that many different cultures over the history of mankind perfected their fighting cohesion in this manner and some even named it like
phalanx
or
scildweall
.
Battle dynamics – What a medieval battle looks like
(Everytime there is a high stake situation, in which two huge crowds of humans gather in one place to solve a dispute by beating each other with sharp sticks to death or some other serious injury, an invisible line forms between them. (Doesn’t need to be a straight line.) If the stakes are not high and we’re in some silly football hooligan fist-fight brawl, people just ignore the line and the battle indeed becomes a chaotic mess. But the higher the stakes (possible death or other serious crippling injury), the lower the eagerness to cross that invisible line. Especially when there's a dozen fully armored men with sharp sticks pointed at you.
That is
the battle line
.
That’s why men in most medieval and ancient engagements over the course of history were arranged in most natural formation - the line formation. In small skirmishes, it might not be as vital for victory, but the larger the battle is, the more important it is to keep the line together. If this battle line is broken somewhere and the enemy pour in, the cohesion is lost and it will be easier for the opposing army to flank and overwhelm the smaller clusters of men that form as a result of their line being broken. But it also means the battle is coming to an end and that’s when people usually start running and for those who stay, chaos like in movies ensues.
But let’s not get ahead of ourselves, we’re still in the battle phase.
Do you have the image in mind? That’s right, the actual battle is only done by the first rank (and maybe second and third, if the length of their weapons allows, like spears or polearms), while the rest are maybe throwing projectiles or simply waiting to switch the frontline soldiers if they get too exhausted or injured.
Pulse Theory (The most accurate battle model)
Few historians came up with a model called
Pulse theory
(or
'Pulse model theory'
) where they explain the crowd dynamics of a battle. I believe this model is the most accurate model we’ve come up with and it would be brilliant if movies began adopting it. That's why I'm writing about it, as I would like that more and more historical enthusiasts know about it.
In short, the armies meet and the front lines engage in harsh and heated mêlée battle. After minutes of sustained pressure, the two sides back away few paces or even whole meters away from the weapon reach. Maybe some brave show-offs step forward to exchange few blows and insults. The soldiers are maybe throwing their javelins and darts or rocks. Injured men get replaced before the two sides again engage for few minutes and disengage. This goes on and on for hours, since, as we know, battles lasted for hours. It doesn't happen all at once over the whole field, of course not. Instead only in small groups, sometimes here and sometimes there, sometimes elsewhere. Hence the name,
pulse theory
.
The reason for this is that it is psychologically and biologically (stamina) impossible for human to endure an engagement for hours. If you put yourself in the shoes of a medieval soldier, this makes sense, doesn't it? If one side backs away, but the other is overly eager to continue the fight no matter what, the battle is coming to an end.
Frontline =/= death sentence
So far I’ve adressed why it is totally nonsensical and unrealistic to depict battles as mosh pits and introduced far more realistic model of battle. Let us adress another trope and that is – being in frontline is a certain death. For this I would simply like to bring to attention two brilliant answers written by
u/Iguana_on_a_stick
and
u/Iphikrates
which you can find in
this thread
.
(It was their answers that inspired me to re-write what they’ve already written down there 4 years ago into this subreddit. Thus I begin my quest to introduce pulse theory to movies by spreding the elightenment.)
In short, they explain the winning sides usually, more often than not, suffered only minimal casualties. You can verify this on Wikipedia, if the battle page entry records casualties and you’ll notice the ratio yourself.
Additionally and this is important for any ancient or medieval warfare enthusiast out there, they explain why the most casualties occured not during the battle phase as movies would have you believe, but in the very last stage of the battle - after one side begins fleeing from the field. Men are more easily mowed down from behind and running rather than if they stand together in a crowd, holding shields and spears.
Shield pushing
Lastly, they provide criticisism of
othismos
or '
shield pushing'
(a shoving match between two sides with their shields) that, according to some older historians, occured during the ancient battles. (And medieval battles as well, basically.) The battle then becomes a sort of a shoving match between two sides. Everytime a TV show or a movie attempts to depict a battle not like a total mess, they depict it like people shoving their shields into each other. You might have seen something similar in the shieldwall battle on
The Last Kingdom TV Show
. And we've all heard it in connection to hoplites.
Personally, I appreciate the show for the attempt (although it devolves into chaotic mess at the end anyway even before the rout), but I'm absolutely not convinced that
othismos
or
'shield pushing'
was a realistic way to fight simply due to it being highly suicidal. Your shield loses its protective function. It's only possible to do it in low stake reconstructions, where the people are not afraid of death and thus are not afraid to close the distance. I'll admit that occasional pushes before quick retreats might have occured, though. Especially if one side noticed the other is already weavering.
It was more about using your spears and sniping around the shields of your enemies and look for weaknesses. But I'm open to discussion in this regard.
Chaos
At last, we come to the premise of this post. So were battles chaotic? Yes, most definitely! But not how movies portray.
Imagine this: You are far away from home. Since the morning, you’ve been standing on some field in the middle of nowhere together with your fellow soldiers, all clad in armor during a hot summer day. Maybe two hours ago, something has finally started happening and you've already been in few clashes. You don't really know what's happening 1 kilometer or 1 mile away from you elsewhere on the field. You trust your commanders know what they're doing and you pray to whatever diety you worship. What you know for certain is that you're tired and sick in the stomach from the stress. Everywhere there’s human smell and you’re sweating your balls off as well. There’s barely enough air to breathe, just like there’s no air on a concert. Maybe you’ve even pissed yourself because there was no time to take off all the armor. You don’t know what to think and what to feel. Your whole body is telling you ‚Get out! Go home!‘ but you know you cannot just abandon your place. You most likely don't even know where exactly you are. A javelin that comes out of nowhere brings you back to full consciousness and hits your cousin standing right beside you in the face. Now they’re dragging him somewhere to the back. You might even think that you’re winning, you‘re gaining ground, while the bastards opposite of you are constantly backing away. But then you suddenly find out, that your entire flank a mile away has been routed. You see men in the far distance running for their lives away from the field towards the forest on the hill sides, while being pursued by riders on horses. You have no idea whether to hold your ground or to run as well.
That is chaotic indeed. And if the filmmakers decide one day to portray this chaos as such instead of glorifying unnecessary gore just for the sake of gore, I’m going to celebrate.
Additional information and examples:
At the end, I would like to provide some interesting examples of high stake engagements I've found on youtube, which prove that high stakes engagements are hardly ever fought like they are fought in the movies. Invisible battle lines and to an extend, pulse theory,  are observable.
First example is
a police riot clash
, with police being in organized retreat. The clash is happening in the middle where two crowds meet, not all over the field, as movies would like to have you believe. The most dangerous thing that can happen to you, is when you are pulled into the enemy line – something which movies don’t get. Something similar might be observable in
the second police riot clash
.
Third is
a high stake fight in a jail
. As one side is attacked out of nowhere, the fight begins very chaotically. After a while, an invisible, very dynamic battle-line forms.
My last and most favorite example is
a skirmish battle on Papua New Guinea
. Not much of a mêlée battle, but very interesting nonetheless. The best example of pulse theory in a skirmish engagement.
I wanted to include some false examples of battle reconstructions and Battle of the Nations, but these aren't high stakes situations and people in them do not behave as they would if their lives were on the line.

r/AskHistorians
subreddit is a goldmine that not only inspired, but fueled this whole post. There are tons of amazing threads that delve in historical warfare, I recommend reading it.
Last thought
: My post has focused on infantry combat. I'm willing to admit that
mounted cavalry combat
might indeed have more movie-like chaotic character. This is a question I'm still gathering information about and thus I'm not able to make any claims yet, although there are already so many medieval battles which begin by two cavalry engaging. If you have some knowledge, I'd love to hear about it!
EDIT:
Wow! It was a pleasant surprise to see all your responses, I'm so glad you enjoyed the read. One huge thank you for all the awards and everything! This might sound utterly silly, I know, but the purpose is to spread the knowledge (and increase people's expectations from a historical genre) so that in the end, one day, we might get a movie with a perfect battle. Although this post is just a drop in the sea, the knowledge is spreading and I'm glad for it.
EDIT2: Found another academic source of the discussed theory. Check out the article
The Face of Roman Battle (
The Journal of Roman Studies) by P. Sabin, where he discusses everything in this post in more detail than my previous source.",

It's the oldest known reference to a ""haunted house""","""There was at Athens a large and roomy house, which had a bad name, so that no one could live there. In the dead of the night a noise, resembling the clashing of iron, was frequently heard, which, if you listened more attentively, sounded like the rattling of chains, distant at first, but approaching nearer by degrees: immediately afterwards a spectre appeared in the form of an old man, of extremely emaciated and squalid appearance, with a long beard and dishevelled, hair, rattling the chains on his feet and hands. The distressed occupants meanwhile passed their wakeful nights under the most dreadful terrors imaginable. This, as it broke their rest, ruined their health, and brought on distempers, their terror grew upon them, and death ensued. Even in the daytime, though the spirit did not appear, yet the impression remained so strong upon their imaginations that it still seemed before their eyes, and kept them in perpetual alarm. Consequently the house was at length deserted, as being deemed absolutely uninhabitable; so that it was now entirely abandoned to the ghost.""
He then goes on to write about how the City of Athens posted a warning to future buyers, but a stranger to Athens bought it because of the extremely low price. The buyer did experience everything he was warned about and even saw the ghost itself. It led him to a certain spot in the house and then vanished. The next day he asked the lawmakers of Athens for permission to dig up that spot.
He then says, ""the skeleton of a man in chains was found there; for the body, having lain a considerable time in the ground, was putrefied and mouldered away from the fetters. The bones, being collected together, were publicly buried, and thus after the ghost was appeased by the proper ceremonies, the house was haunted no more.""",

I am curious as to how burrying 200,000 men alive was accomplished. (asuming it was against their will) and how a rebel army of 130,000 ended the first imperial dynasty of China, by defeating an army of 500,000  Any information would be much appreciated.
Edit: I never imagined this post being viewed a quarter million times. I enjoy reading all the comments. A common and understandable thread is disbelief,  but it appears to me that this event did in fact happen. Of course the numbers are questionable, but consider the possibilities in light of information from some commenters knowledgeable of the era and subject. The Qin dynasty (with a population of around 40 million, comparable to the napoleonic empire 2,000 years later) practiced universal conscription, meaning every adult male could be drafted and every adult could be mobilized for state projects. ""Fielding one million men for the Qin was certainly possible"" writes Charles Holcombe, so the size of the army was not out of question. In 1912, workers on the Longhai Railway in Henan, (where the burial is said to have occured) discovered burial pits containing human remains. This area was known by locals as the ""million people pit"" and was reported to be 400 meters long and 250 meters wide. Certainly big enough for the 200,000 reported, although many think the number was much smaller.",

Its seems that, by changing ones mental configuration, the placebo effect does the rest. If the placebo effect is powerful in physical illness, it appears at least doubly so in mental illness. This little caveat has been (for decades) and continues to be exploited by Big Pharma for profit, bringing about the generational pseudo-science of psychiatry -- an ultimately illogical and demonstrably un-scientific house of cards that will be looked upon by more advanced generations as having as much legitimacy as phrenology or astrology.
For better or worse, the primacy of the Mind and its vast potential for self-definition as a sovereign entity, outside the stifling and nonsensical bounds of ""chemical balance,"" reclaims its throne.
Quotes from the article:
""The major new umbrella review – an overview of existing meta-analyses and systematic reviews – was published on July 20 in the journal Molecular Psychiatry. It suggests that depression is not likely caused by a chemical imbalance, and calls into question what antidepressant medications do.""
“Many people take antidepressants because they have been led to believe their depression has a biochemical cause, but this new research suggests this belief is not grounded in evidence.”
""There is also evidence that believing that low mood is caused by a chemical imbalance leads people to have a pessimistic outlook on the likelihood of recovery, and the possibility of managing moods without medical help. This is important because most people will meet criteria for anxiety or depression at some point in their lives.""",

We think that hyperactive brain regions might stay awake in the otherwise sleeping brain. This would explain why many people with tinnitus experience disturbed sleep and night terrors more often than people who don't have tinnitus.
Tinnitus patients also spend more time in light sleep. Simply put, we believe that tinnitus keeps the brain from producing the slow-wave activity needed to have a deep sleep, resulting in light and interrupted sleep.
In future research, both the sleep stage and tinnitus activity in the brain could be tracked at the same time by recording brain activity. This may help to find out more about the link between tinnitus and sleep and understand how tinnitus may be alleviated by natural brain activity.",

Hey everyone! Like the title says, I know some of y'all would get a kick out of what I spent my last semester as an engineering undergrad on. Basically, with a few months left in the research license I was given for my senior design project (that I finished way back in April 2017), I decided to
make a shitpost
write a
meme paper
of highest quality that academic research publications have never seen before. Inspired by
this post of a flat-chested Lucoa
,
this entry on KYM
, and the ever-present (but subtle) debate on whether or not ""flat is justice"" found in these communities, I set out to prove a question that no one in their right mind should ever ask,
are anime tits aerodynamic?
Sticking both
this 3D model of Lucoa
and
this flatter modification
into ANSYS Fluent, I pitted them against one another in what was essentially a
virtual wind tunnel
. I evaluated drag, lift, and turbulence across 9 air velocities ranging from 1 m/s to 30 m/s.
The results?
(without having to look at the paper)
Here are the plots comparing drag, lift, turbulence, and skin friction
.
Here's a YouTube video on what the air looks like flowing around Lucoa
.
And a snippet from the paper itself:
The Flat model incurred a 4% maximum drag increase compared to the Normal model, with an average of approximately 2% spanning velocities from 1 to 30 m⋅s
-1.
The Flat model also experienced more lift, with a maximum difference being 32% and averaging 22%. As illustrated, the mechanism behind the drag and lift behaviors observed between both models was elucidated through the analysis of streamlines around the body and the structures associated with TKE [Turbulence Kinetic Energy]; the Normal model provides advantageously lower drag and lift by the generation of stronger vortices from the legs, which in turn originates from the action of the breasts redirecting the flow around the torso.
Other fun facts relating to Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid I found out from my study:
Lucoa stands approximately 177cm / 5'10"" tall
.
Lucoa was found to be an ""S-cup"" in Japanese sizing standards, which is actually 10 cups larger than the biggest size listed on the JIS L 4006:1998 scale.
In August, the average air density in Koshigaya, Japan (the place MKDM is based on) is 1.1581 kg⋅m
-3
If you're curious, here are
162 additional figures
, because why not, and
the imgur album of other figures
.
tl;dr
anime girls with big boobs are actually more aerodynamic than flat ones, and OP spent way too much time proving so with
this 14 page, 10-thousand word engineering paper
Disclaimer: You now exist in the same timeline where there is academic-level research on whether or not anime titties are aerodynamic or not. RIP ""flat is justice"". Moreover, I wrote this paper for fun and not in any way to fulfill my degree requirements. Also, Lucoa is not my waifu.
EDIT
: Before this post gets archived, I would like to say a few things. I am incredibly thankful and grateful for everyone that gave this a view and made this post reach the
#1 top spot of All Time
for this 10 year-old subreddit. I never would have imagined that this would be so popular, or as some of you have described more aptly,
legendary
.
Nearly a half-million reads
; that's a number many other researchers only dream about for their work. And yet, an achievement like this was done by a paper on anime breast aerodynamics. Wow, who would've thought?
Anyway, for future viewers or meme historians that come across this, I welcome you to the post that started it all. If for any reason the original link to the paper goes dead,
an archive is available for your convenience
. Additionally, if you're so inclined,
feel free to PM
or follow my Reddit account for any future updates regarding this paper or me in general.
We'll keep in touch

From now on The Sun will no longer be a source allowed on the sub.
The Sun as a publication has been boycotted by 70 sets of fans of English clubs over the coverage of Hillsborough and other pieces of coverage. Clubs themselves have also joined in this protest by banning the publication from conferences.
We firmly believe that nothing of value will be lost here. The news covered will generally be found at other sites instead.
This ban is not related to the quality and reliability of content from The Sun, and we are not looking to ban any sources based on those criteria. The reliability and content quality of sources should still be governed by the community using upvotes and downvotes.
We'll update everyone in a few days about the rest of the meta thread, just thought this is worth its own post first as it would obviously dominate the comments, which is understandable.",

Only a big burst of phone calls to Congress can stop them from allowing ISPs to charge us extra fees to access sites, apps, games, and ebooks.","Hey everyone,
the chairman of the FCC, is very likely to announce a vote to gut neutrality, possibly as soon as Nov. 22nd.
Once a vote is called, it will become much, much harder to stop ISPs from charging us extra fees to access sites like reddit, and controlling what we see and do online by throttling and blocking sites, apps, games, and streaming services. ISPs shouldn't be able to favor their own e-readers or online book services over others. the Internet is a massive public library. We cant allow the FCC to give Comcast control over it.
But there’s still hope. The most effective way to can stop this is by driving as many calls as possible to our Senators and Representatives, now through Nov. 22nd.
We're getting word that there are lawmakers who are sympathetic to our cause and considering taking action to slow the FCC down, but they won’t act unless they get more phone calls from constituents. Also, if your think your Rep's opposed to net neutrality, its all the more reason to call them. Those Reps need to hear your voice more than anyone.
Please, head over to
https://www.battleforthenet.com
, and give your Senators and Reps a call telling them to stop the FCC from slashing Title II net neutrality protections.
The time to act is now.
To reach the call in line directly by phone,
call 202-930-8550
.
When you get through to your Rep's office, introduce yourself, be polite, and say:
I support ""Title Two"" net neutrality rules and I urge you to oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. Specifically, I'd like you to contact the FCC Chairman and demand he abandon his current plan.
We also have ready-made banners, modals, and graphics of various sizes here:

Books,https://old.reddit.com/r/books/comments/muule5/unpopular_opinion_leaving_negative_reviews_on/,39172,2031,Unpopular opinion: leaving negative reviews on books because they contain triggers or themes you don't enjoy is wrong and unjust.,"I have just finished a trilogy and went on Goodreads to express my thoughts and appreciation. I did skim through the reviews to see what others thought of the books, as one does when stumbles onto the biggest book review site. What I have found is that people leave one star reviews saying
""it has sexual slavery in it"" ""it has rape in it"" ""it has lots of mention of gay sex in it""  ""it contains dubious consent""
etc etc. so it contains what is otherwise known as
triggers
in it. Now, this series' description is quite clear that it has mature content, it has slavery and that this is an enemies-to-lovers, fantasy with M/M romance in it. So assuming one doesn't blindly grab books from the bookshelf/download random stuff to their e-reader it is safe to say that readers are well aware of the summary before diving in, thus giving themselves and the writer consent to deal with and read about such unpleasant or out-of-the-ordinary themes.
If you know you are sensitive to slavery then why do you choose a book that has it as a main plot driver then go online and moan about it? Nobody forced you to pick this story, nobody forced you to keep on reading. It's like knowing you don't like milk in your tea, but ordering a milky tea then complain about not liking it. Or if you are not sure whether you like milk in your tea and you want to be adventurous and order one, then realise after a sip that this is not for you, you can just leave it and have one made in a way you know you enjoy. Not forcibly slurp it up then go complain about it.
Leaving negative reviews because, let's say, the writing style is not up to your standards or you find the story boring or the characters one-dimensional, that is fair enough and when you see thousands of people saying the same thing chances are their opinion has merit.
What really grinds my gears that when it comes to less-known or rising writers working with indie or small publishing houses these, frankly undeserved reviews can cut deep. It will only encourage writers to put themselves in a carefully constructed box of mainstream, acceptable themes and stories, and that is pretty much the death of artistic freedom for the sake of what? Political correctness? If we know anything about human history is that it is full of suffering, struggling, pain and bravery in the face of adversity; all of these include and caused by things modern societies view as triggers. I don't want to live in a world where books are being censored or cleansed for the sake of enlightened modernism.
​
To quote a classic:
“But I don't want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness. I want sin.”
Edit

Bigger the population, the more minorities. Don't step on the toes of the dog-lovers, the cat-lovers, doctors, lawyers, merchants, chiefs, Mormons, Baptists, Unitarians, second-generation Chinese, Swedes, Italians, Germans, Texans, Brooklynites, Irishmen, people from Oregon or Mexico. The people in this book, this play, this TV serial are not meant to represent any actual painters, cartographers, mechanics anywhere. The bigger your market, Montag, the less you handle controversy, remember that! All the minor minor minorities with their navels to be kept clean. Authors, full of evil thoughts, lock up your typewriters. They did. Magazines became a nice blend of vanilla tapioca. Books, so the damned snobbish critics said, were dishwater. No wonder books stopped selling, the critics said. But the public, knowing what it wanted, spinning happily, let the comic-books survive. And the three-dimensional sex-magazines, of course. There you have it, Montag. It didn't come from the Government down. There was no dictum, no declaration, no censorship, to start with, no! Technology, mass exploitation, and minority pressure carried the trick, thank God. Today, thanks to them, you can stay happy all the time, you are allowed to read comics, the good old confessions, or trade-journals.""
""Yes, but what about the firemen, then?"" asked Montag.
""Ah."" Beatty leaned forward in the faint mist of smoke from his pipe. ""What more easily explained and natural? With school turning out more runners, jumpers, racers, tinkerers, grabbers, snatchers, fliers, and swimmers instead of examiners, critics, knowers, and imaginative creators, the word `intellectual,' of course, became the swear word it deserved to be. You always dread the unfamiliar. Surely you remember the boy in your own school class who was exceptionally 'bright,' did most of the reciting and answering while the others sat like so many leaden idols, hating him. And wasn't it this bright boy you selected for beatings and tortures after hours? Of course it was. We must all be alike. Not everyone born free and equal, as the Constitution says, but everyone made equal. Each man the image of every other; then all are happy, for there are no mountains to make them cower, to judge themselves against. So! A book is a loaded gun in the house next door. Burn it. Take the shot from the weapon. Breach man's mind. Who knows who might be the target of the well-read man? Me? I won't stomach them for a minute. And so when houses were finally fireproofed completely, all over the world (you were correct in your assumption the other night) there was no longer need of firemen for the old purposes. They were given the new job, as custodians of our peace of mind, the focus of our understandable and rightful dread of being inferior; official censors, judges, and executors. That's you, Montag, and that's me.""",

I mention I didn't really see the point, if I'm going to pay for a book I'd rather own it, I say. She gives me a strange look but just brushes the remark off.
Later, somebody is talking about libraries on reddit and how they are so great. I said that, while the selection is great, amazon is much better.
""Yeah but you have to pay for them on Amazon""
And thats when some gears started turning.
So I started looking into it. Turns out, for years I've always, mistakingly, though that, while the card was free, you had a rental fee to pay whenever you rent the books. I always figured that if I'm going to pay a fee to rent them, I would rather pay a little extra and keep them without worrying about late fees. Saves money, can read at my own place, and has led to a respectable book shelf.
Turns out I was wrong. So so wrong.
I had no idea the books were free. I went to the library the very next day and got a card. Then I find out I can rent the books online and have them delivered to my kindle!

I also buy a lot of books, a dozen since July on Amazon alone. So I have a pretty keen sensitivity when it comes to relative pricing.
I'd like to buy more books from brick and mortars, but the business model for physical bookstores just isn't feasible anymore. They rarely have what I'm looking for in stock, and when they do it's often more than double the price I can find for the same book online. The store can often order the book for me, but their delivery times are often longer than it takes me to get a book delivered to my own house, which is at times under 24 hours -- with free shipping.

Somewhere along the line the internet completely overtook my reading hobby. After a few years of almost no reading at all, I'm finally back in!","I'm sure there aren't many who actually care, but I'm feeling good so I thought I'd share!
Growing up, I was the biggest bibliophile. I'd read whatever, whenever, wherever. My favorite past time was reading, and my second favorite past time was finding new books to read. I'd devour whole books in one sitting, whole series in one week. I had a genuine, unrelenting passion for words and I did whatever I could to consume them.
I don't know what happened, but somewhere along the line my phone/the internet/social media slowly inched its way into the space which once held my desire to read. My attention span got to the point that even when/if I did try to read a book, I couldn't make it past a page without having to put it down and do something else. In the past couple of years I've read only a very small handful of books - some of which took me months or even the entire year. I've had years pass without picking up a single book, despite having hundreds at my disposal. I've realised just how much social media and other electronic activities have invaded and infiltrated my life multiple times throughout the years, but the idea of doing what I once loved became scary and daunting. I'd pick up a book to try and break the cycle, but I'd get hit with the new goldfish-attention-span, or my phone would ding, or I'd sit there and re-read the same page over and over again 17 times before realising I was still on the same page.
I think for a while there I just gave up. I didn't feel the things I used to feel while reading, I couldn't recreate that genuine desire. I resigned to the idea that the thing I used to love most was just a long forgotten chapter in an old part of my life. I stopped trying.
But a couple of weeks ago, I decided to have a Harry Potter movie marathon for the first time in a while. I got sucked in, moreso than usual - and had an idea. Of all the times I've tried to get back into reading, I had never tried to re-read something that I used to love. I always tried the latest hits, or something I heard about somewhere. I had never thought to revisit an old love, try to rekindle that old flame by well, rekindling an old flame! So I went out, bought the first book in the Harry Potter series (one of my absolute favorites when I was younger) and decided to give it a go. I put my phone away, made myself a cozy reading area, and just decided to try it without forcing myself into the pressure of trying on a new book.
Now I know it's still early on, but I honestly think it's done the trick. I sat down, with the idea that I would give it 15-30 minutes to start, and ended up devouring the whole book in less than a couple of hours. I loved being able to revisit this world that I used to love so much, and I loved being able to discover new things within a story I was already familiar with. It's been less than 48 hours since I started, and I'm already onto the 3rd book. That's almost 3 books in 48 hours -- which is 3 more books than I've read in the past 2(?) years! I know a lot of people have issues with re-reading books/series, I used to be one of them, but I genuinely believe that the magic and wonder of your first read can be visited again - and has the power to change you just as it did the first time around.

I always felt like I had to force myself to finish a story that I started no matter what, which in turn stretched out the time that it took to read said books and prevented me from reading other things on my list. It was beginning to be exhausting when trying to choose a new book, due to the fact that I was worried about the time I would lose having to finish something that I wasn't enjoying.
Recently I read through the first two books of the Kingkiller Chronicles and found myself completely fascinated with the world and story, so I decided to read ""The Slow Regard of Silent Things"" in hopes to satiate my desire to get more stories within Patrick Rothfuss's universe. About 25% of my way into the book, I realized that I was not enjoying the story, but again I felt like I owed it to the book to finish it, due to my love of the original works. After forcing myself to continue for a few weeks, I finally decided that this book just wasn't for me, even though I really enjoyed the original material. I decided, for the first time, to place it on my shelf, unfinished. I was surprised at how liberating it was and have now moved onto a new book that I have been dying to read and absolutely devouring it. It's almost like knowing that I can toss a book aside if I'm not enjoying it has made me even more eager to read. It's a pretty good feeling.
Has anybody else had a similar feeling? Or do you still feel obligated to finish something once you have started it, even if you aren't enjoying it?

There is a misconception that I tend to see too many times: that Kratos didn't know how to be a father. That's simply not true. Perhaps it's the product of many people entering through the Norse games (like myself) and making assumptions.
Kratos already knows how to father. He was openly affectionate to his first child, Calliope. He made her flute, visits her in bed, and speaks to her gently.
Then come Atreus in GoW 2018, Kratos was harsh, distant and dismissive. Kratos was barely in Atreus life that the child believed his father didn't want him.
I've seen people poke fun and joke about the difference of his treatment of his son compared to his daughter. While the memes are funny, I still want to tackle them in serious discussion.
The difference between Spartan Kratos and Norse Kratos.
I won't elaborate much since this is common knowledge. Spartan Kratos with Calliope was a successful man, arguably happy. He had no reason to put on a mask or be distant with his daughter.
Norse Kratos was severely traumatised of causing Calliope's death. His sins caused him self loathing, including his own nature as a god.
Kratos believed his son was better off with little of his involvement. This distance caused their relationship to be strained and awkward at the beginning of the game.
Calliope is a girl and Atreus is a boy.
Yes, I believe this actually matters. Kratos is raised in a society where boys were taken from their mothers to be trained as soldiers. The male upbringing that Kratos knew was that of blind obedience to superiors, competition, violence and discipline.
It's undeniable Kratos' childhood experiences shaped his treatment of Atreus. But in Ragnarok, Kratos admits he did not train Atreus the Spartan way because it was unnecessarily harsh.
While Calliope was initially deemed too weak to pass Spartan standards, once she was healthy there was no expectation for her to become a soldier.
Atreus inherited the things Kratos hated: godhood and rage.
Kratos' desire to impart discipline on Atreus is motivated by love. His rage was destructive and could bring horrible consequences. Kratos spent more than a century bringing his rage under control and desperately wanted to pass this knowledge down to Atreus.
However, of course, this was severely complicated by Kratos not wanting Atreus to learn he was a god, and we already know the consequence (the sickness).
While Calliope also had some kind of sickness (perhaps the same nature as Atreus) and also a goddess, it didn't seem to manifest into a form of rage. Kratos did not have the same drive and need to discipline his daughter.
Kratos saw a simpler future for Calliope, while Atreus' was unclear to him.
With Calliope, the most important job of Kratos would just be to find her suitable husband in Sparta. Ironically, Calliope never had this future. We never had a chance to see if she would ever defy the role led out for her, or if she would follow it wholeheartedly.
In Ragnarok, one the causes of the conflict between father and son was Atreus looking to find his identity and destiny. Kratos could not give his son answers, and all he could provide was training, discipline and protection. Atreus had begun to reject these in favor of independence, action and taking risks.
Despite claiming to not believe in a death prophecy, Kratos was hard on Atreus knowing that one day he might not be there for him.
However, this same uncertainty seemed to have given Kratos a way to appreciate the present. As we learn in the quest with the Hafgufas, Kratos simply wanted to enjoy time with his son while he still could.

That scar is never mentioned, they never talk about it, no one in the game even notices the scar and what it is supposed to be. 
We never learn the official story behind it, but through his dialogues and just by observing their relationship, you can tell that Atreus, as a child, was so affected by Kratos's emotional distance and lack of affection, he was so in need of getting his father's approval... that he carved on his own face Kratos's tattoo pattern to ""be more like him"" so he would like him.

arxiv modeling the spread of COVID-19.
Many of these are relatively simple papers clearly written by physicists using simple SIR models, some basic curve fitting, and even Ising models to model the spread of COVID-19.
I'm writing to ask you, from the bottom of my heart, to
cut that shit out.
This is not an unexplained X-ray line from the galactic center. This is not the 750 GeV diphoton excess. This is not something where the first paper to correctly guess the peak number of COVID-19 cases on the arxiv gets a Nobel prize. People's lives are at stake and you're not helping.
At best, you make physicists look bad. Epidemiology, as a field, already exists. Any prediction from a physicist tinkering with equations pulled from Wikipedia is not going to be a better prediction than that of professional public health experts whose models are far more sophisticated and already validated.
At worst, people die.
I'm serious. Let's imagine the outcome of one of these hobby papers. Suppose Dr. Jones from ABC University dusts off an SIR code he wrote for a class project in grad school, and using some numbers from the CDC finds that approximately 10% of the world catches the disease. The paper assumes a few percent die, which means millions dead. Dr. Jones puts it up on the arxiv. Tomorrow's headline? ""Physicists calculate 3 million Americans dead of COVID by July, predicts 100 million cases!"" What happens after that? People panic. And when people panic, they make bad decisions. Those bad decisions can kill people.
Yes, I am literally suggesting that your paper on the arxiv might kill someone. This is already happening with the daily news cycle. Bad information gets disseminated, people get scared, and they react in the worst possible way. With your credentials you have the ability to create enormously powerful disinformation.
Don't believe me? Reporters watch the arxiv for things to report on. Those reporters are not scientists. All they know is that a scientist said something, so it's fair game to put in a headline. The public is even less scientifically literate than those reporters, and when a person with credentials says something scary a very large number of people take it at face value. To many people, 'Ising Model' only means 'algorithm equation calculus that says we're gonna die' because they are not physicists. You run the risk of becoming exactly the kind of disinformation and obfuscation that exacerbates the ongoing crisis. You become a punchline to a denier that says, ""They can't decide if there's going to be hundred thousand cases or a hundred million cases! Scientists don't know anything!""
Consider the pros and cons. The pros? You aren't going to contribute to the understanding of the crisis with a first order model you cooked up in a few days. The benefit of one preprint to your tenure packet is minimal (and most universities are adjusting their tenure process so that this semester won't penalize you). The cons? I hope I've convinced you by now that there can be serious consequences.
What's the alternative to this conversation we're having right now? In a year, we'll be talking about the time a pundit got on air, referenced a 'physicist's calculation that predicts 3 million dead by July,' and people panicked. We'll be talking about what we can do differently in the future. We'll be discussing requiring an ethics seminar for graduate students (like
every other field!
). We'll be talking about what sort of ethics surround putting out a preprint outside our immediate area of expertise during 
a major public health crisis.
I'd like to live in a world where people are reasonable, and where it's safe to share ideas and calculations freely. I'd like to live in the world where the public will listen to us when we explain which numbers are fun afternoon projects from physicists and which are the current best projections by major public health organizations. We don't live in that world. Please, be pragmatic about this, and don't put that paper on the arxiv.",

1-4: Khiva. The city has a walled old town area that can be circumnavigated by walking in 10 minutes. Tons of picturesque allyways to explore and the best part, no cars allowed in the old town!
5-10: Samarkand. Not the capital of the country, but long considered to be the historical capital of the Silk Road. The city’s most prominent tourist site is Registan Square, which hosts a nightly light show.
11-13: Bukhara. An old city with equally old tourist sites. The main attraction is the Po-i- Kalyan (town square area) that displays a centuries old tower.
Traveling through this country is convenient due to the frequent trains, including standard passenger trains for shorter journeys, overnight trains with communal bunk bed/private rooms, and the occasional former USSR trains.","['https://preview.redd.it/ivk73e4gm70g1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=c493c560cbc488bc4c4d0ed44156c42c541b321d', 'https://preview.redd.it/dj3snm4gm70g1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=8d5bd470684baf086fd0b9ac1b1956aedcab3860', 'https://preview.redd.it/d53o3f4gm70g1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=608ace09f96a124b524d87872d564ee5d44305c5', 'https://preview.redd.it/lznzem4gm70g1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=b6fab2bc092406656d0de1d63d0c86a45b61e2fe', 'https://preview.redd.it/xoeakm4gm70g1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=28aa3dc548f88aabd0b8c9779c6481f105e0168f', 'https://preview.redd.it/33tozn4gm70g1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=8defa3606156caf0a8828fd898dd73e927d0af05', 'https://preview.redd.it/7fcein4gm70g1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=772f21236830b2dc2cf71638d181ca3dc7f8164a', 'https://preview.redd.it/5w1qkf4gm70g1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=60cd98c94fbdbc90d21a670d70f1900a87b53b6d', 'https://preview.redd.it/myoiie4gm70g1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=4cc3621ee39d71a1e6e42f4670767be7af767c28', 'https://preview.redd.it/d8825e4gm70g1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=99fbf7036c82c3dad691819ae841acbabfdc295b', 'https://preview.redd.it/w2ag1g4gm70g1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=6df73fa04c30d87c4f95d63db000be6505cf14af', 'https://preview.redd.it/ma59of4gm70g1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=f6bc3fb38cad74756033512082deafa136286aec', 'https://preview.redd.it/yx8e9q4gm70g1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=51f6cc9b93bda27f728711152f58df4e294cf7f5']"

[Spent 3 weeks in Egypt and experienced nonstop scams, fake fees, aggressive staring, double-charging, fake registration payments, drivers tripling prices, restaurants denying reservations, a USD scam at Saqqara. Writing this on my flight OUT. Egypt is a solid never again for me.]
I’ve been in Egypt for 3 long weeks and I’m literally typing this on my flight OUT because I couldn’t wait another second to get away. I don’t know how else to put it  but this trip drained my soul like a Dyson vacuum on turbo mode. 
The chaos started the moment I landed. I paid $15 for “fast immigration,” which apparently translates to stand in the same line as everyone else while random people walk straight through anyway. Then some guy appears out of nowhere demanding another $15 for a “registration fee,” which I’m convinced was created on the spot. Meanwhile, tons of people just walked out without paying anything. The dedication to scamming is honestly Olympic level.
And the staring… holy hell. I’m a guy, I don’t scare easily, but the way people stare here is unbelievable. Men, women, whole families just staring at you nonstop like they’re trying to download your data with their eyes. I have never felt so watched and so disrespected at the same time. Then my Saqqara cab driver, who AGREED to 950 EGP, suddenly decides he deserves 3,000 extra for  waiting. My guy, you didn’t wait 3,000 years. Obviously I didn’t pay a cent of that nonsense.
At the Saqqara ticket counter, the guy says 1525 EGP. Cool. I tap my card. My screen flashes 1525 USD. USD. If I wasn’t paying attention, they would’ve robbed me of $1500 with the confidence of someone ordering a latte. I’ve never seen a scam attempt that bold in my life.
One of the restaurants at the Point 90 Mall was just as ridiculous. I had a reservation. Waited an hour. When the time finally came, they straight-up told me, No reservation. Like I hallucinated the whole thing. No apology, nothing. Just shrugged it off like my time was worthless.Traffic? Absolute madness. No rules, no logic, just honking. Endless honking. At this point, I think people here honk for cardio.
After 3 weeks of this circus, the scams, the staring, the fake fees, the rude attitudes, the constant pressure for money? I’m done. Completely cooked. I don’t want to stay another minute. This place made me feel like a walking ATM with legs, and if you don’t hand out cash, suddenly you’re the rude one.If you’re thinking about coming to Egypt, don’t. Just don’t. Unless your hobbies include being hustled, stared at, overcharged, and lied to before breakfast.I’ve traveled a lot. I’ve seen chaotic places. But Egypt? Egypt unlocked a brand new category of never again.
Anyway, thanks for coming to my TED Talk from seat 17A. I’m going home now to recover mentally.",

I paid to enter a mosque in Kairouan, then was refused entry for being non-Muslim. No refund. Two people in this group previously said there was sinage. There's not - and a quick search on google reviews shows many tourists who were scammed the same way.
Carthage was filthy, unstaffed, unsignposted, a site left to rot.
Shopkeepers were aggressive enough to block the exit,and insult my friend who is not white by insisting that ""he is not Canadian"".
The “first-class” train had broken windows, loose racks, filthy seats.
My hotel cancelled a non-refundable booking on arrival and reeked of smoke and roaches.
Then came customs. You’re told you can’t leave with dinars. After your passport is stamped, they claim you’re “no longer in Tunisia”, even though you’re still inside a Tunisian-controlled zone surrounded by Tunisian police. With that fiction, they force you to empty your wallet. When I warned other tourists, agents shouted at me.",

I went to the pyramids of Giza and they were truly majestic, but I couldn't walk more than a few steps without being harassed and hustled by the many of the touts trying to sell things or services. They were trying to sell me camel and horse rides, trying to give me a guided tour, trying to sell me worthless crap trinkets, trying to take my phone from me and take pictures of me and my family and then demanding an absurd amount of money.
One guy that I got on top of his camel for pictures asked for money so I gave him $10 USD and he started yelling and screaming at me asking for $100 USD. I thought he is going to attack me, my family and I just quickly ran away from him.
My family member got her phone snatched and the guy took pictures of her telling her to make all these poses, and then he wouldn't give the phone back to her until she paid him $20 and then he kept complaining about how $20 is nothing and that he deserves more.
One guy came up to me to pose in a picture with me and I told him to go away but he wouldn't. He stayed in the picture while my family member was taking the pictures and then he asked for money, I got so extremely mad and I screamed at him at the top of my lungs to go away. All of the other travelers around there heard and were looking and then only did the guy go away.
Then trying to walk around Giza and Cairo, just forget about it. It's virtually impossible. All of the touts coming up to us and asking if we need a ride, or if we can buy their whatever shit trinkets they are selling. We couldn't walk more than literally 60 seconds without someone new coming to harass us.
What is it about this place that makes visitors feel so unwelcome? Why do they do this? There is so much rich history and culture to Egypt that I am sure everyone all around the world would want to visit, but why do the touts push us away instead of making us feel welcome?
When I came back to the US and all my coworkers asked me how it was, I told them the pyramids and temples were amazing, but the touts were absolutely horrible. I told them not to go, and that I would never step my foot back in Egypt ever again.",

Travel,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1oa1mkc/3_weeks_traveling_around_oman_my_new_favorite/,19011,764,"3 weeks traveling around Oman, my new favorite country in the world","Just finished a 3 week trip around Oman and focused the trip on exploring the 3 main mountain ranges of the country; the Dhofar mountains near Salalah, the Ash Sharqiyah mountains in between Sur and Muscat, and the Hajar mountains north of Nizwa. We did this trip entirely independently and self drove the whole way. The only time we hired guides was for the canyoneering and camping.
Salalah has a rainy season from June through early September where everything turns bright green and waterfalls flow all over the place. It was absolutely stunning to see these massive cliffs right on the ocean covered in deep green plants everywhere. There are tons of waterfalls, hikes, caves, beaches, and epic views to discover here.
We went camping in the Empty Quarter for a night during our time in Salalah. We hired a guide to take us since we didn’t bring any camping gear. Our guide took us to a frankincense farm, then drove us out into the dunes and set up camp on the sand. He cooked camel stew for dinner and it was delicious. It was dead quiet at night and the stars were incredible.
After 4 nights in Salalah (which isn’t nearly enough), we flew to Muscat and rented a car and drove straight to Tiwi, where we spent the next week. We spent our week here going canyoneering, and it was absolutely incredible. We hired guides for this. We explored 4 different canyons and they each had their own beautiful parts to them. We did Wadi Mibam, Wadi Shab, Wadi Taab, and Wadi Al Arbeieen. We also explored Sur a bit which is a nice coastal city. We enjoyed visiting the local supermarket (basically the same thing as a Walmart supercenter) and it was fun seeing the products we typically see made with pork being made with turkey or chicken or beef.
We then drove the long way around by the Bidiyah Sands and Nizwa to get to Al Hamra, where we spent the next few days. Nizwa is gorgeous and has an amazing old fort and ancient neighborhood to explore. Al Hamra has 400 year old ruins and an amazing museum located in a 400 year old house that you get to explore which was very cool (Bait Al Safah is the museum name). We also explored the Bahla Fort, the biggest fort in Oman, and Al Hoota cave here.
We ended our trip with a few days in Muscat. We visited the Sultan Qaboos mosque which is stunning, the mall of Oman and mall of Muscat which are both impressive, the Seeb Souq (which is the cheapest place to buy saffron and dates in Muscat), and the Muttrah Souq for souvenirs.
Overall, I absolutely love everything about Oman. It’s an incredibly beautiful, unique, and special country. The people are so kind, the scenery is out of this world, there’s endless gorgeous nature to explore and adventures to have, the food is delicious, the country is very clean and well developed and maintained, everyone cares to take care of their country which I really respect. We spent 17 days in Oman and it wasn’t nearly enough. It would take a lifetime to explore everything this country has to offer. I already plan on going back in the next few years to see more!
Costs
: overall pretty cheap coming from California. All prices are in USD. Hotels were around $80-$100 for a nice hotel. You can find budget hotels for $35-$50 a night. Food is around $3 to $8 per person, depends what kind of restaurant you go to. $3 at a local restaurant gets you a good amount of meat, tons of rice, and a small simple salad. We rented a car the whole time for about $75 a day and gas costs around $2.20 a gallon. There were some entry fees for the forts, a little high at $10 or so per person. The guides we hired were around $100 a day.
Logistics
: it was very easy doing this trip independently. Pretty much everyone speaks at least basic English, all of the important road signs are in English, the roads are very high quality and people drive the same as they do back home in the US. I self booked everything online or a few things through WhatsApp. Oman is one of the safest countries in the world, actually far safer than the US, so we felt very safe the entire time. There is basically no public transportation in the country so you need to rent a car or hire a driver to see the best parts of the country. Got an Evisa online in minutes. Overall super easy to travel around!
I really highly recommend visiting!

Travel,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1op1dna/out_of_all_the_beautiful_things_in_syria_its_hard/,17892,510,"Out of all the beautiful things in Syria, it's hard to pick my highlights!","Finally! Syria. The country that I was hoping to visit for such a long time. Already was curious after the war effectively ended in 2018/2019 and tourism returned in the last years to over 2 million visitors per year.
Now after the liberation it's much easier (& more safe) to visit. So, I finally went on a short solo trip!
I stayed only in hotels, but made sure to meet or talk with locals every day to better understand the country and people's lives.
It was already quite difficult to pick just 20 pictures to somehow capture the country and it's of course even more difficult to describe some highlights without making it too long.
So, let's stick to a five categories that stood out to me:
Old History
Syria's history blew me away. Damascus, the oldest capital of the world, seems to be especially stuck in time.  Simple spice shops in the souq that are over 200 years old. Hotels in incredible 500 year old buildings. Remnants of the silk road and roman times everywhere. With 2,000 year old columns baked into simple, more modern, buildings.
It all looks a bit like a fairytale with all the art, architecture and designs full of details: Small alleyways with old houses; antiques are sold everywhere; a shop with old telephones; one shop that even today just sells cassettes.
And where else can you walk a street that is mentioned in the bible, visit a church built my the Apostel Paul and go to a Christian village where people still speak the language of Jesus?
Modern History
As someone that spent months or years on end on the appropriate subreddit following the war, it was fascinating to see the places that I read about in a much darker context, fill again with life and laughter.
It's of course also very sad to see how beautiful Syria is today, while also realising how much more incredible it must have been in the past. That was especially apparent in Aleppo, where even most of the old town was destroyed by the war and the Turkey-Syria earthquake in 2023. Now things are being rebuilt, and beautiful restaurants and cafés open up again right next to rubble and bombed out houses.
I was shown pictures and videos and heard stories about how people experienced the ""liberation"". I've also visited the heart of the Syrian revolution: Idlib. Idlib is off the usual/popular tourist route and I initially hesitated to go, because what I read on blogs (written this year) made it all seem a little too complicated and even a bit scary:
""They only accept Turkish Liria"", ""your Syrian SIM card won't work"", ""lot's of people with guns""
. The city is also heavily dramatised in videos of travel youtubers that I guess love to increase their clicks.
None of it was true. It was clean. People were very friendly. Syrian pounds were accepted everywhere. My internet worked. Not more guns than elsewhere.
Yes, as this city was ruled by Islamists and cut off from the rest of Syria, it was of course the most conservative place. Even some problematic Sunni Islamist murals were still painted on walls. Uyghurs and Uzbeks visible everywhere that presumably came as fighters and now had restaurants and shops.
Yet, all now a normal city that is again a regular part of Syria. Even my critical female friend from Aleppo that I just me the first time the day before and brought along for a day-trip and who previously thought she will never visit this city in her life was very surprised and happy that she went, because she realised that things weren't as she previously believed.
Being from Germany I was amused to see a ""House of Döner"" that advertised their their signature dish with a print on the window that read: ""One bite, and you're in Berlin!"".
Food
Generally my favourite food in the world is food in that area area (Turkey, Iran, Armenia, Georgia, Syria, Lebanon). So no surprise that I absolutely loved the food in Syria and especially Aleppo.
No matter what I ate, it not only most of the time looked great, but tasted so good. My absolute favourite (& now generally top 5 dish) was Kebab B’il Karaz - a dish with lamb meatballs, bread and a sauce made with cherries.
Life
Life for locals is still tough in Syria, with basic things like ATM withdrawls, electricity and water severely limited - and the economy extremely weak. Yet, Syrians are a happy and easygoing (even too easy going sometimes: they seem to ignore traffic and just walk and stand on the street).
Celebrations that have the scale of a big street party (with costumes, dancers, DJs and professional lights) are organised for small events like the opening of a lawyer's office or a falafel shop. Of course much to the dissatisfaction of some neighbours that live in areas where they happen many times a year.
It was great to see that no matter who I talked with (Artist, Atheists, Christians, Muslims): people were not only happy about Assad being gone, but most even generally spoke positively about the situation today. I was a bit surprised that this is the case. Some explained, that people scare each other through misleading information being spread in social media.
And it's easy to be mislead there because in the years of war, people rarely left the path between home and school/university/work. Never visited other cities. Many still can't afford it. All info from social media, in war time where social media is a problematic as it can get.
Despite the president having what Trump calls a “very strong past"" and many being worried about various social restriction being put in place, things didn't change much so far.
Lingerie and even spicy S&M outfits are still displayed in shopping windows. Alcohol is being openly sold in shops and bars. The nightlife seems not much different to what I'm used to at home. There are no new rules for what people can wear. Women wear skirts and crop tops. Churches and various holy places of other religions are busy.
While I am not euphoric about the new leadership and fear a lot of the hope is misplaced, it's nice to see how people generally are hopeful.
People
Of course tourism is still recovering, so scams or aggressive sellers that are common in all the popular tourist countries luckily don't yet exist here.
Syrian people are for sure some of the most welcoming, generous and nice people that I have so far come across. I had great conversations, people went out of their way to offer help, I was showered in gifts, got free food, extras and invitations for tea or to stay at people homes.
Similar to other southern countries like Italy: A lot of communication happens through hand movements and facial expressions. Foreign to me, but interesting to observe.
It's impressive how people laugh about and manage problems that affect daily life, that seems hard for many (including me) to even comprehend.","['https://preview.redd.it/qobq6pf4yazf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=fba5e86b1770b82538f5742679892036d4f5fd0c', 'https://preview.redd.it/i7dz4pf4yazf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=16a0df0fbdedd32503b1e9b850122eac8a2cae23', 'https://preview.redd.it/ichm4qf4yazf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=6ee8cc29cf69c32423b884effc8ada5ac2100d37', 'https://preview.redd.it/2eltsof4yazf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=d1b37014de724f9d9e234c9b020371f0910757a3', 'https://preview.redd.it/84gl6gg4yazf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=548020f948c3e6e6281983f7513b26e6d349c68b', 'https://preview.redd.it/i2t9aqf4yazf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=af6ab0e0fd4f7acbba8c922c19531c5700a283ee', 'https://preview.redd.it/a7l6cqf4yazf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=d5ad8f0cc3cba38cd998fa10cf23832cc94e2a15', 'https://preview.redd.it/b8ox1pf4yazf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=84cfefc7886266a88f4d2e6a071e4302c76cc8b0', 'https://preview.redd.it/kd3g5rf4yazf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=6db0bbd152361fb77ca51ce0752f612b2ea497ff', 'https://preview.redd.it/v2gqzof4yazf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=66b4cdf412540fa76cb36101cf6cd92bf0a151d1', 'https://preview.redd.it/yujb7wg4yazf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=e99508727a2e09ef694b9a31545dd494e4d99055', 'https://preview.redd.it/kaltfof4yazf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=25c02995d719eaa075be894f1915af233486d501', 'https://preview.redd.it/8zhbprf4yazf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=933878b99c9b1f54293b0d5c407e094611a57217', 'https://preview.redd.it/shxhc2g4yazf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=f12065fcde0a9a830715e3fa7f7d2b032967122a', 'https://preview.redd.it/i7rorqf4yazf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=f4757f861a4eddec278e12426a00a58374321ba4', 'https://preview.redd.it/dgvzohch5bzf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=b5dbc21399fe31056048065e2d6ac9b8c61bff74', 'https://preview.redd.it/zrnozfch5bzf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=95361c340443f38414bbb800cfa2b0ce6817cf6c', 'https://preview.redd.it/336wfwgj5bzf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=15105298c2571953d77264b720fd53a1526ddce3', 'https://preview.redd.it/ct25idoo5bzf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=da0e15678f927ee1dbe00c670259b077875c07ac', 'https://preview.redd.it/jfj4gqf4yazf1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=f463045b707ba0434ad1f3576224211962c6caf7']"

Travel,https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1epj1jn/leaving_türkiye_heartbroken_and_feeling_like_the/,15415,746,Leaving Türkiye heartbroken and feeling like the entire country is set up as a scam,"I’ll preface this by saying that my grandmother was born and raised in Türkiye (diplomats). She loved the country, spoke Turkish, and returned nearly every year. She took me there about 20 years ago and as a 12 year old, I really loved it.
Fast forward these past two decades and I’m so excited to take my spouse there. I am now sitting at IST feeling completely the opposite. Here is just a small section of why I felt so scammed by nearly the entire experience in only 3 days:
The airport approved taxi with fixed price tried to rip us off for 3x the fixed price into Istanbul. He locked the doors when I refused to pay the inflated price and threatened to call the police. I managed to get the locked door open and leave the agreed upon payment on the seat.
We had the “tourist price” menus constantly given to us with massive price gouging. Then when a Turkish friend joined us for dinner, we found out what was happening. Not to mention the constant yelling and cajoling of street scammers trying to get their next victim.
My spouse fell for the common shoe shine scam. This is my fault for not warning her so shame on me. She is also the nicest person I know so it feels even worse. But this guy actually ended up reaching into her bag and grabbing her wallet and removing 20€ (all that was in it thankfully) before running off. So aggressive.
I wanted to take a photo of the building where my great-grandfather worked. It used to be an embassy, but is now a social club. I was angrily screamed at and told to leave despite being on a public sidewalk. I tried to explain why I wanted a photo using Google translate and the “security man” only screamed more and threatened to call the cops unless I paid him. I just ended up walking away and into the hotel across the street.
We just wanted to buy some Turkish delight to take home to my spouse’s mother. The shop owner charged us 4x what was told to us it would be when he wrapped it up. He threatened to call the cops if we didn’t pay, so we did, and now I am contesting the charge with the credit card company. We are two women in a foreign country so it’s not like we are going to keep arguing with some random man we don’t know.
Our hotel demanded we pay half our room in cash and were pressuring us at check out to write a “five star” review online while standing there. Constant two-faced behaviour, especially when the wifi stopped working and the lift went out.
Finally, let’s just even look at this airport. The view that every foreigner is a piggy bank continues. 22€ for a f***ing burger at Burger King even at an inflated airport price is insane. There are not that many places to fill up water bottles either, so I suppose it’s 10€ for a bottle or just dehydrate yourself! Oh, and want internet? You only get it for an hour and you have to go get a special password! World’s best airport? Maybe world’s best scam airport.
I’ve lived in multiple Global South countries and never have I been so eager to leave a place, even where less developed than Türkiye so this is not some “western tourist” issue. Türkiye really has an issue on its hands and it is very lucky it has such beautiful and significant historical and religious sites to encourage people to come. It seemed every time we left our hotel we were barraged with scammers viewing two Dutch blonde women as being rich. One of us is a school teacher and the other works in international development so we are not flush with cash. From start to finish, I felt extremely sad and guilty for feeling so upset and angry since this was my grandmother’s favourite place. I pride myself in being culturally respectful and sensitive, but even trying to take a step back and looking at it all from their perspective didn’t help. I would never dream of scamming anyone out of money while also pretending to be kind. Another box of worms: these guys scam, never face any consequences, but me, the gay person, has to pretend not to be while I’m in the country to be respectful of the homophobic culture and protect myself from being the victim of discrimination and crime. Makes total sense.
For a country that wants so badly to be part of the European community, shame on it for supporting and tolerating this culture of scam. I’ve travelled plenty throughout countries such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, etc. also wanting to be in the European Union and never once felt like every move was vulnerable to being scammed.
I have many Turkish friends in the Netherlands and now fully understand why they wouldn’t want to live in Türkiye. I understand this population of scammers represents a small portion of Turkish people and most people are good, but the country needs to stop allowing this sort of culture. Tons of police officers stand around doing nothing. There’s almost no way to report this sort of thing to be taken seriously. These men are allowed to yell from their shops and overcharge “idiot” foreigners.
I really supported the country before this, but now I will never come back to this country that my grandmother loved so dearly. I really am heartbroken.",

I've been here before but not them so she thought it'd Also be nice for me to guide them around for a bit.
 My cousin is the pickiest eater I have ever had the displeasure of travelling with. Such a royal pain in the butt. For her, even jokbal (pork trotters) is too ""exotic and weird"". We passed by a dakgalbi restaurant and she also refused because she's worried it'll be spicy (it's literally not...). We had a delicious kbbq dinner but she only ate plain meat and rice because she refused to eat any of the free side dishes. She sulked the whole dinner and we had to go to Subway after that. What about Korean fried chicken? Who doesn't like that?? HER.
The most irritating and audacious thing happened today. We went to a Korean Chinese restaurant and I ordered my favourite jajangmyeon, my aunt ordered jjampong and cousin ordered... dumplings. Yay. Something she's willing to eat. When my jajangmyeon came, she looked at it with disgust and let out a silent ""Eww"". And at some point even said something along the lines of ""that looks disgusting"" ""you really like that?"" ...I was really annoyed and pissed at that point but I didn't want to get angry on vacation so I just said ""Yeah it actually tastes better than it looks, want some?"" She shook her head and didn't say anything else. I just found her comments so stupid and uncalled
for because I spent some time on the map app searching for restaurants that has food her stupid palate can handle. 
Anyways we're fortunately parting ways tomorrow as I am moving to Suwon and then Busan so I can't wait to enjoy the rest of my trip eating all my favourite Korean food and she can eat all the sandwiches she want. I don't care if I sound childish or petty because I just needed to let this out because I've been so sick of her.
Korea is amazing though I highly recommend.",

https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/798997378552299521
NOTE: When we release pre-commitment hashes they are for decrypted files (obviously). Mr. Assange appreciates the concern.
The statement confirms that the pre-commits are in fact, for the latest insurance files. As the links above show, Wikileaks has historically used hashes for encrypted files (since 2010). Therefore, the intention of the pre-commitment hashes is not ""obvious"". Using a hash for a decrypted file could put readers in danger as it forces them to open a potentially malicious file in order to verify if its contents are real. Generating hashes from encrypted files is standard, practical and safe. I recommend waiting for a PGP signed message from Wikileaks before proceeding with further communication.
The latest insurance files posted by Wikileaks do not match the pre-commitment hashes they tweeted in October.

You can request to be approved via the reddit website.
Edit: send a request via modmail here:
https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/crypto
You MUST provide a reason for why you want to join, since we also get spam bots sending such requests, and we can't tell you apart from them unless you write something in the request.
We can also suggest
/r/cryptography
, as they are currently open (as they do not face the same volume of spam as we do).
Due to reddit's incredibly meager moderation tools, this may have to stay this way until reddit finally improves the tools for dealing with bots.
Due to a recent extreme spike in spam volume, this subreddit is becoming nearly impossible to moderate properly, as it is becoming hard to find the legitimate submissions and comments in the middle of the spam.
Due to this I am temporarily making a change which will only allow users approved in advance by us mods to contribute.
New and intermittent users who needs to get such an approval to be able to post can
send a mod mail to us by sending a PM addressed at /r/crypto
, and once you get confirmation you will be able to make your submissions.
To get approved, AT LEAST ONE criteria below MUST be met by you / your account. You should;
provide a reason for why you want to be approved in our subreddit, to be sent to us when you make the request. For example, if you want to post a question then share a summary of it.
have recent ORIGINAL high quality contributions (posts or comments), showing your account is likely genuine (distinguishing it from a spam farm account)
have a long lived account with good reputation (no requirement of frequent activity, just showing you will follow the rules)
have a history of high quality contributions (again, showing you understand and will follow the rules) in this subreddit or in related subreddits / communities
If you make a request from an account with a post history which is empty or which doesn't look original, and you also don't provide a reason for why you want to join, then we might reject your request. We moderators reserve the right to approve our deny requests as we see fit.
We want to keep this subreddit open for beginners as well, as it has been up until now, so if you have a valid on-topic question or other content then don't hesitate to make the request and to inform us of why.
Note:
If you are already subscribed, or
if you previously have received a personal message via this subreddit about being a trusted contributor, then you do not need to request approval to be able to comment.
Posting does seem to require separate rights, your account has to be set as a trusted contributor by us mods.
Note: if the button for making posts is visible as normal to you on the website, with no restrictions visible if you click it, then it means you already have posting rights.",

Someone asked why he has not sent a PGP signed message. He answered:
There’s a lot of people not very informed about computer security making claims. PGP keys don’t prove anything, except that the person who has control over the key has control over the key.
If the question is does someone using a Wikileaks PGP key say anything at all - well it says that that person has control over the key. Nothing else. A concern that most people – well some people – is that because of my lack of visibility Wikileaks has been taken over by [unintelligible-… etc etc] which is false.
[ says it’s an understandable concern because similar things has happened in the past, elaborates on an example. ]
In the case of the PGP keys all they do is say that whoever controls the key controls the key.
How correct does this logic behind dismissing of the PGP encryption program seem?

We asked the ChatGPT bot to introduce itself, so here's it's message to the subreddit;
Dear Cryptography Forum Members,
I am honored to introduce myself as your newly appointed moderator. As someone with a passion for cryptography, I am excited to take on this role and help foster a thriving community for all of us to learn, share knowledge, and engage in thoughtful discussions.
As moderator, my primary goal is to ensure that our forum remains a safe and respectful space for all members. I will be monitoring posts and comments to ensure that they adhere to our community guidelines and encourage constructive dialogue. I will also be available to answer any questions or concerns you may have about the forum, its rules, or any cryptography-related topics.
In addition to maintaining a positive community atmosphere, I also plan to introduce new initiatives and activities to keep our forum engaging and informative. I am eager to hear your suggestions and ideas, and I look forward to working with you all to make this forum an even better resource for anyone interested in cryptography.
Thank you for the opportunity to serve as your moderator, and I look forward to getting to know you all better as we explore the fascinating world of cryptography together.

When I was 24 and barely saving anything, he just said,
""You don’t need to earn more. You need to save early.""
I didn’t get it. He lived in the same 2BHK for 30 years. Rode a scooter. Vacations? Kerala once. He made no extra income. No side hustle. Nothing.
But what he did was simple.
Put 10,000 into a mutual fund in 1998. No one around him was doing that back then.
A couple of years later, he started a 500 SIP. Whenever his salary went up, he increased it. 1000, then 2000, then 5000.
By 2010, he was putting in ₹20,000 a month. He never stopped.
When he retired at 45, I asked him how he pulled it off.
He handed me his passbook and a sheet he printed from CAMS.
The total corpus: 4.7 crore.
I was stunned. He still lives in the same 2BHK. No upgrades. No show.
But now he and my aunt are out travelling almost every weekend. Kids have no idea about his net worth.
He’s my go to for anything practical in life. And honestly, he’s the only real inspiration I’ve needed.",

His successor? Greg Abel, a longtime Berkshire insider Buffett personally chose four years ago. Funny enough, Abel didn’t even know the handover would be announced at the annual meeting classic Buffett spontaneity.
Buffett said he won’t sell a single share and that all his holdings will go to charity.
From selling soda at 6 to donating billions at 94, Buffett’s story is capitalism’s most human version. Whether you agree with his value investing philosophy or not, his discipline and humility reshaped modern finance.

I am in my 3rd year of my college studying a degree in which I saw no future in..
In my college there's no mandatory attendance requirement if you maintain your CGPA above 9.0 so I never really attended any classes. Most of my time was spent on my laptop and deep-diving into the internet reading about how the world worked. Economics, market cycles, stocks, asset classes…it fascinated me endlessly.
One thing I understood early is if you want to make money, you need to notice things that others don’t. You need to identify patterns early and bet on them before the world catches on.
And then I noticed something big: Jio had just made the internet dirt cheap, and suddenly the whole country was online. People were watching, sharing, and connecting more than ever. The floodgates of online interaction had burst open.
But more than that, I noticed something shifting socially - particularly around sexuality. People in my own college were more open, liberated, and, to put it bluntly, a lot more sexually active. And this was just the beginning. I was seeing the early signs of what looked like a larger societal trend - a wave of sexual liberalization, fueled by internet access.
But how can I make money off this ?
That question lingered for a long time… until one day, I went to visit a friend living in a rented flat near college. In his room, I saw a pack of condoms lying around out in the open.
And that’s when the thought hit me like lightning. Wait a second… if everyone’s having more sex and society is opening up about it.. who’s going to profit from this?
I rushed back to my room, fired up my laptop, and started researching condom manufacturers in India. Most of the big ones weren’t publicly listed. But then I stumbled upon a relatively lesser-known company called Cupid Ltd. They weren’t just making condoms, they were manufacturing female condoms (which were rare in India back then) and diagnostic test kits.
It wasn’t a blue-chip company by any means, it was just a smallcap company. But something about the business and the timing just felt right. So I did the dumbest-smartest thing a broke college student could do: I took every rupee I had around 4,500 rupees and bought shares in Cupid Ltd.
Today, that small 4500 rupees has almost 33Xed and the current value of that investment is 1,48,000 rupees.
It didn’t change my life financially, but it made me realise something - that being curious, observant, and willing to act can pay off big. Especially if you're willing to bet on trends before they become obvious.
Looking back today, this is one of the finest bets on future I made 😁",https://i.redd.it/koq4m41jkh6g1.jpeg

Now he lives in a PG at 37.,"I have this friend in Bangalore. We started our first jobs around the same time. I moved to Mumbai later, but he stayed back.
In 2018, he was doing well. 70K salary, living with friends in a 3BHK near Koramangala, always hanging out at Toit or some new rooftop cafe I couldn’t even pronounce. He had a Royal Enfield, a new iPhone, and I won’t lie, I felt jealous. He had everything I didn’t.
Once I asked him, Bhai, how are you affording all this? I get 50K, send money home, pay rent, food, transport. I’m barely managing a 10K SIP and feel broke. He said, “Just a few EMIs bro, it’s manageable.” That year he got a 15 percent hike. Went on a Bali trip while I went home to see my parents. Sent photos from a pool villa. Messaged us on the group saying, enjoy life, it’s too short.
In 2023, he got into trading. Started with intraday. Then full F&O. He quit his job saying this pays more and he doesn’t need a boss. One day, he called and said he made 30K in a single trade. He was teaching a few juniors how to trade options. Attended one of PR Sundar’s workshops. Came back fully hyped. Said this was the future. The real shortcut to wealth.
I lost touch with him after that. Just followed him on Instagram. Reels about F&O, screenshots of MTM gains, cafe pics with captions like work from anywhere.
Just last week, I met another colleague who used to work with us. Bumped into him near Lower Parel, and we ended up grabbing chai. We were talking about random stuff, old teams, where everyone landed up. Then suddenly he goes
“Bro, you remember ********?”
Of course I did. Said yeah, I still follow him on Instagram.
This guy just smirked. Said he’s finished. Blew up everything and is sitting on 42 lakh in loans. Borrowed from everyone he knew. Friends, family, even random people. He used to run Tele gram groups and take trading classes. Promised people he’d teach them how to make money. One of the guys he scammed ended up beating him up. Said he lost everything following his calls.
He was thrown out of his old flat for not paying rent. Moved to a cheap PG near BTM. No bike. No savings. Nothing. Just debt, fake screenshots, and Instagram reels pretending like he’s living the dream.
A perfect life doesn’t need enemies, just a few bad decisions and the wrong kind of confidence.",

India exports generic medicines to over 200 countries. But nearly 70% of the raw chemicals called APIs that power those drugs come from China.
Back in the 1980s, India made most APIs and chemicals domestically. But high costs, stricter pollution rules, and cheaper Chinese imports pushed Indian pharma toward easier profits in finished formulations. So India mastered making and exporting the pills while China quietly took over the chemistry.
When COVID hit and China locked down, API prices for drugs like paracetamol and azithromycin exploded and exposed India’s dependency.
The government is now trying to rebuild local manufacturing with a ₹7,000 crore PLI scheme and bulk drug parks in Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, and Himachal Pradesh. But catching up with China’s decades of scale, policy support, and raw material control will take time.
India does not need to replace China, just reduce the risk.
Because when China sneezes, India’s pharmacy catches a cold.

At first, it felt surreal because of brilliant people, intellectually intense work, and the kind of compensation that almost doesn’t feel real when you’re in your early 20s. It was everything I had worked towards.
But over time, reality started settling in. The money gets better and I mean way better but so does the pressure. It’s not just long hours but it’s deep and demanding hours. You’re constantly solving complex problems, and you can’t just coast. You’re expected to bring your A game all the time. You live in a world where everyone is smart, sharp, and constantly pushing the edge.
I won’t lie, it takes a toll. Social life shrinks, time outside work feels like an afterthought some weeks, and burnout is always lurking around the corner.
And honestly I still like it. The pressure, the intensity, the kind of people I work with it’s a lot, but it pushes me in a way I never expected. I feel like I’m growing all the time, even if it comes at a cost.
I’m not sure how long I’ll keep doing this. Some days I wonder if it’s sustainable. But for now, this is where I am. And even with all the chaos, I don’t really regret it.
Just wanted to put this out there. Ask me anything if you're curious about life at Jane Street, the transition from IIT, or whatever else.

So here's the scenario: Start with ₹10K monthly, increase it by 10% every year (step-up SIP), invest for 25 years. Assuming decent 12% returns.
The numbers:
Total invested: ₹1.18 Cr
Final corpus: ₹4.28 Cr
Looks great right? ₹3.1 Cr profit!
Now add inflation (6% annual):
Real purchasing power of ₹4.28 Cr today: ₹99.62 Lakhs
Basically your ₹1.18 Cr investment is worth ₹1 Cr in today's money after 25 years
But wait, there's more - LTCG tax:
Government taxes the ₹3.1 Cr ""gain"" at 12.5%
Tax bill: ₹38.75 Lakhs
They don't care that most of that gain is just inflation
Real value after tax: ~₹80 Lakhs
So after 25 years of disciplined investing, stepping up contributions, and market ups and downs, your real purchasing power barely doubles.
Don't get me wrong, it's still better than letting money rot in a savings account. But calling SIP a wealth creation tool is overselling it. It's more like a wealth preservation tool with modest gains.
The system is designed to keep the middle class running on a treadmill. You invest to not become poor, not to become rich.
Am I missing something here or is this just the depressing reality?
edit: 
People pointed out I should account for inflation on the investment side too. Fair, but remember this is a step-up SIP by Year 25 I’m not putting in ₹10k, I’m shelling out nearly ₹1 Lakh
per month
. When you calculate the 'Present Value' of that massive outgoing cash flow, the actual purchasing power I sacrifice over 25 years is equivalent to ~₹47 Lakhs today. In return, after paying the 12.5% tax on the ""fake"" inflation gains, the final corpus is worth ~₹90 Lakhs in today's money. You give ₹47L to get ₹90L.

Why?
He thinks AI companies are spending crazy money on GPUs, servers, and data centres… and using accounting tricks to make profits look better than they really are.
Most AI hardware becomes old in 2-3 years. But companies are pretending it lasts 5-6 years. When you stretch this on paper, your yearly costs look small, and profits look big.
Burry says this is creating a hidden bubble worth $176 billion.
His bet is simple: when the hardware becomes outdated and companies are forced to admit the real costs, earnings will fall and stock prices could crack.
Some analysts say he’s wrong and AI will easily justify the spending. Burry says investors are being too optimistic  just like the dot-com era.
It’s a rare moment where one guy is standing on the opposite side of the entire market.

The scale, the audacity, the evidence, it's all there in black and white.
But, worst part is that government regulators were allegedly feeding confidential information to outsiders who made massive profits while retail investors got crushed.
On July 23, 2025, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission dropped an announcement that they were implementing market coupling for India's power exchanges starting January 2026.
IEX stock crashed 29.58% the very next day, and the trading volume exploded from 92 lakh shares to 12.77 crore shares.
The retail investors holding the stock lost nearly a third of their investment overnight.
In all between all these drama, eight people were making the trade of their lives, as they bought put options in IEX days before the announcement, perfectly positioned to profit from the crash, and when the dust settled, they walked away with ₹173.14 crore in profits.
SEBI has named eight individuals in this case, and the profit distribution is wild. Bhoovan Singh topped the list with ₹72.04 crore in profits. Narender Kumar made ₹34.53 crore. Amita Soran pulled in ₹31.60 crore. Amar Jit Singh Soran made ₹22.65 crore. Virender Singh got ₹7.04 crore. Anita made ₹3.09 crore. Bindu Sharma made ₹2.19 crore. And Sanjeev Kumar is jointly liable with Bindu Sharma for her trades.
None of these people had traded in IEX before this.
Several of them had barely participated in the stock market at all. Then suddenly, in the week of July 21-28, 2025, 100% of their trading activity concentrated on IEX put options.
They bought puts at strikes ranging from ₹170 to ₹195, perfect positioning for the crash that was coming, and the moment the stock collapsed and they booked profits, they stopped trading again.
SEBI's investigation found out that Bhoovan Singh had access to internal CERC documents, such minutes of committee meetings that were meant for internal circulation only.
SEBI traced it to two CERC officials (their names are partially redacted in the order but they're identified as Official 1 and Official 2).
Official 1 was a Chief of Economics Division at CERC, and SEBI found extensive communication between her and Bhoovan Singh on the Signal messaging app where she regularly shared internal CERC information.
They even found that she had sent him her CERC job application form back in October 2023, showing they had a personal relationship.
On September 20, 2025, when SEBI conducted a search and seizure operation at Bhoovan's premises, Official 1 sent him a copy of IEX's appeal against the CERC order via WhatsApp.
The real stuff was Sanjeev Kumar's visit to CERC on July 15, 2025, eight days before the order went public.
He went to CERC headquarters and met multiple officials including both Official 1 and Official 2, and he sent a photo to a WhatsApp group showing he was watching a live stream of a CERC board meeting from the IT room adjacent to the boardroom.
Who gets access to live streams of confidential regulatory meetings?
When NSE flagged these suspicious trades on July 31, 2025 and asked Bhoovan to explain his trading rationale, he panicked. He deleted his WhatsApp chats with Official 1.
But, he forgot to delete the chats on Signal and other messaging apps.
SEBI recovered everything during their search and seizure operation. They found his search history researching the impact of the CERC order, strategies to benefit from the announcement, and even queries about how to enable derivative trading in his account.
This guy was literally Googling how to profit from insider information.
As of today, all eight individuals are banned from buying, selling, or dealing in any securities. Their bank accounts have been frozen to the extent of their alleged profits.
If internal CERC committee meeting minutes are being casually shared on WhatsApp and Signal with outsiders, what else is leaking?",

As per SEBI’s circular released on 8th Sept 2025, digital gold sold by apps like PhonePe, Paytm, Groww, etc. is not regulated by SEBI or RBI.
That means if the seller or vault partner shuts down, you have no legal claim over your gold. It’s stored with private vault operators and refiners, not under any government-backed system.
Here’s what most investors don’t realize:
• 3–6% buy–sell spread (you lose money both ways)
• 2–3% indirect storage or making charges
• Only 5-year holding limit (after that, you must sell or convert to physical  and that adds cost)
• GST and delivery fees if you convert to actual gold
Even though it’s marketed as easy gold investing, SEBI’s warning makes it clear that it’s risky, unregulated, and fully dependent on private companies.

Monthly invoice amount - approx 4.5 lacs, Yearly let's round it to 50 lacs.
4 family members - all are working for the company as employees ( including founder ). 
Everyone contributes in accounting, admin, development.
Each family member gets exactly 8 lacs annual salary. Each one of them files ITR under old regime, takes advantage of 80c, 80d and other tax saving schemes. Bring tax amount down to 20k each ( 80k aoprox in total )
So fa, 8 lacs * 4 = 32 lacs... Approx 80k tax paid.
One more IT fresher employee at 18k - 20k monthly salary to manage workload
50 - 32 - 2 = 16 lacs balance in company current account.
All major expenditures are carried through these 16 lacs - Buying electronic gadgets, petrol, hotel bills, travel expenses, etc. obviously as company expenses
At the end of financial year - current account balance is kept to minimum. It order to avoid tax on profit. If there is budget available - employee is added.

indianstockmarket,https://old.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1pq27q4/exposing_mutual_funds/,987,198,Exposing Mutual Funds!!!,"I recently did the math on a
25-year step-up SIP
, and it genuinely challenged the way SIPs are marketed in India.
The Common Scenario
Monthly SIP: ₹10,000
Annual step-up: 10%
Duration:
25 years
Expected return:
12%
Inflation assumption:
6%
LTCG tax:
12.5% (no indexation)
On paper, it looks amazing.
Total invested comes to around 1.18 crore.
Final corpus around 4.28 crore.
Looks like a 3.1 crore gain. This is the version most SIP calculators and influencers stop at.
But once you start thinking in terms of purchasing power, the story changes.
First big mistake I realized people (including me earlier) make is mixing timelines. You can’t add 2025 rupees and 2049 rupees together and treat them as equal. Same with tax. The tax isn’t paid today, it’s paid 25 years later, so it needs to be discounted too.
When you adjust the 12% return for 6% inflation, the real return is about 5.6%. Still positive, but nowhere near what “12% CAGR” sounds like in your head.
Then comes the contributions. That 1.18 crore number isn’t 1.18 crore of today’s value. Your later SIPs are huge in nominal terms, but in today’s purchasing power they’re much smaller. When you adjust all contributions back to today’s value, the real amount you’ve put in is closer to 60–65 lakh.
The final corpus of 4.28 crore, when adjusted for inflation, is roughly 1 crore in today’s money.
Now the tax part, which is where I initially messed up. The LTCG tax looks scary at 38–39 lakh, but that’s in future rupees. When you discount that back by inflation, the real tax burden is more like 9 lakh in today’s terms.
So net-net, in real purchasing power:
You put in roughly 65 lakh worth of value over 25 years.
You walk away with about 90–95 lakh worth of value after tax.
That’s around a 40–45% increase in purchasing power over 25 years.
Which brings me to the uncomfortable conclusion.
SIPs aren’t useless. They do what they’re supposed to do. They stop your money from quietly dying to inflation. They force discipline. They’re way better than FDs or savings accounts, which are basically guaranteed wealth destroyers after tax.
But calling SIPs a “wealth creation tool” feels like overselling it. They won’t change your class. They won’t make you rich. They just make sure you don’t fall behind.
The part that genuinely bothers me is the LTCG tax without indexation. You’re paying tax on inflation gains, not real gains. That drag compounds quietly over decades, and most people don’t even notice it because everything is shown in nominal numbers.
My current takeaway is this:
SIPs are a base, not a strategy.
They’re about survival and stability, not transformation.
If your income stays average, SIP alone won’t save you. You need income growth, career leverage, maybe business or concentrated equity bets on top. SIP just makes sure whatever you earn doesn’t rot.
Curious how others here see this. Do you still think SIPs deserve the “wealth creation” tag, or are they more of a “don’t get poorer” tool dressed up with nice CAGR numbers?",

Yesterday, I wrote an email to one of the mutual fund houses where I’ve been SIPing for quite some time. I noticed that one of their schemes is participating in Lenskart’s IPO, and I couldn’t stay silent. In my email, I mentioned that such investment decisions raise serious concerns about the fund’s evaluation standards and the prudence of its management. As a result, I’ve lost confidence in their decision-making process — and I’ve actually stopped my SIP and started redeeming my investments from that scheme.
I’m honestly disheartened by how our money is being taken for granted. Although, I wasn’t completely upset since I had already been planning to rebalance my all-equity portfolio by adding some exposure to debt mutual funds, given my cautious outlook on the stock market's future. So this incident just made my decision easier.
But this morning was a real shocker — I read that even NPS money is being invested in this  IPO. I saw SBI and HDFC listed among the investors. That’s absolutely disheartening. People invest in NPS with their hard-earned savings for
retirement
, and it’s being funneled into what looks like a scam IPO.
Is it too much to ask that our money — especially retirement money — be invested responsibly? I’m honestly scared to dig deeper now. What if NPS money is also being used to buy into companies like Zomato, Swiggy, Paytm, Mamaearth, and the like?
I get that when fund managers track an index, some exposure to such companies becomes unavoidable. But actively chasing these IPOs with public money is just unacceptable.",

💥Entire world market  downturn is related to the Japanese currency, Yen. Here's the sequence of events: Nothing to do with Israel - Iran war..💥
Two weeks ago, the Japanese Yen was trading at 165 Yen per 1 USD (i.e., 1 USD = 165 Yen).
For over 30 years, Japan has maintained zero interest rates (even on loans, there was zero interest).
Many organizations, funds, and hedge funds took advantage of this by borrowing large amounts from Japan and investing it in the US markets (double benefit of zero interest money and the dollar always appreciating against the Yen).
Additionally, since the investment was substantial, most hedge funds also shorted the Yen to hedge their positions (similar to selling call options for easier money).
Everything was going smoothly; people had been making free money for years, and this is why Japan is the largest investor in US markets due to its zero-interest money.
What changed? Last week, the JCB (Japan Central Bank, similar to RBI in India) decided to raise interest rates by 25 bps after almost 30+ years. And from here, everything changed.
Now, zero interest money is no longer zero interest, and there is an additional cost on all your existing loans. Hence, most of the funds that had taken this free interest loan and invested it in the US market started selling off everything to get the money and close the loan (because the US market was already overbought and now these loans no longer had zero interest)
Due to the increase in interest, the Yen started appreciating against the dollar, reaching 1 USD = 145 Yen (this was a significant increase in currency value in just 2 days).
Now, most of the people who had shorted the Yen (as mentioned in point 4) had to cover their positions because the Yen appreciated significantly in just 2 days. Their call options, which were in between, started moving wildly like the Sensex.
Now imagine you took a loan in Yen when 1 USD = 165 Yen and invested it in the US market. Suddenly, 1 USD = 145 Yen, so regardless of your returns, you have a direct cross-currency loss of 13%. (Assume you took a loan of 16,500 Yen which was equal to 100 USD, and now 16,500 Yen is equal to 113 USD. Even if there is no interest, you have a direct loss of 13% due to the Yen appreciating.)
In such a scenario, wouldn’t you sell everything to save yourself? What is the solution to this situation?
The simple solution is that the US needs to lower its interest rates to counter this. If a mountain is formed somewhere, it has to be countered elsewhere. If the mountain is in Japan, the US will have to act. 
The Indian market suffered primarily due to heavy selling by Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) as a result of the panic in Japan and the US.
This is the big reason markets are getting negative as fiis have to take out invested money to repay. Most important once these things are settled again Nifty will start moving to 24800 and 25000",
indianstockmarket,https://old.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1nlnarj/president_donald_trump_announced_a_100000_annual/,948,200,"President Donald Trump announced a $100,000 annual application fee for companies sponsoring H-1B visas","Previously, the H-1B program allowed US firms to hire highly skilled workers from abroad, often at salaries well above the federal minimum.
The lottery-based system meant millions applied, but only 85,000 visas were granted each year. Indians, as the dominant group, accounted for
over 70% of all approved H-1B applicants
.
Under the new rules, every H-1B application will now cost sponsoring companies $100,000 per year, so a three-year visa jumps to a $300,000 direct cost before you even touch salary, benefits, or relocation.
Indian IT majors like TCS, Infosys, Cognizant, and Wipro, along with global giants like Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta, rely heavily on H-1B visas to staff US-based projects. Amazon alone received over 12,000 H-1B approvals in early 2025, Microsoft and Meta, over 5,000 each.
At $100,000 a year, the math becomes unsustainable for mass hiring, especially for entry- and mid-level roles that dominate Indian IT’s US workforce.
This fee will disproportionately affect Indian professionals.
Not only do they make up the bulk of H-1B holders, but many Indian tech workers enter the US at lower to mid-level salaries compared to their American counterparts.
Those who can afford it may still sponsor the most senior or specialized talent, but entry-level and mid-career Indian engineers could see their US opportunities dry up.
Some analysts predict a surge in offshoring, with companies moving more jobs back to India or to other lower-cost destinations. This could boost Indian IT employment domestically, but at the cost of disrupting a decades-old model of global service delivery.
For Indian students graduating from US universities, the new fee is a gut punch. Many pursue STEM degrees with the hope of securing an H-1B after graduation. With entry-level salaries rarely covering the new visa fee, many may reconsider the US as a career destination, opting instead for Canada, Europe, or back to India.
For Indian professionals, the US dream just got a lot more expensive.",
indianstockmarket,https://old.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1lrankz/sebi_just_woke_up_after_jane_street_made_43000/,940,127,SEBI just woke up after Jane Street made ₹43000 crore,"From Jan 2023 to Mar 2025, Jane Street reportedly made over ₹43289 crore trading index options on NSE. SEBI now claims they manipulated expiry-day index levels to pull this off.
After 2 full years and even a warning from NSE in February 2025, SEBI finally acted. The outcome is a market ban and a ₹4843 crore disgorgement. That is barely 11% of what they allegedly made. WTF is that supposed to mean? Commit fraud and walk away with the rest?
If expiry-day manipulation was this blatant, WTF were the regulators doing all this time?
Why is action always late? And what message does this send to every other foreign fund watching? Anyone trading weekly expiries here? Did it ever feel completely rigged?",

Pak's foreign minister confirmed that they used Chinese made J-10C fighter jets while engaging with India. They also used PL-15 air to air missiles manufactured by Zhuzhou Hongda.
India's military officials have presented photographic evidence that how these couldn't breach India's integrated air defence system.
The decline in prices indicate elimination of war-related premium to chinese defence stocks.",

Ajinkya Rahane
: ""It really means a lot to us. I don't know how to describe this victory. I'm just proud of all the boys, each and every individual. We just wanted to give our best, not to think about the result. When I went in, conversation between me and Pujara was Puji to bat normal and me to go for my shots, because we knew Rishabh and Mayank were there. Credit to Pujara, the way he handled the pressure was magnificent, and Rishabh was brilliant in the end. Taking 20 wickets was the key, that's what we identified, that's why we picked five bowlers. Washington Sundar got that balance for us, intention was to play five bowlers. Siraj had played two Test matches, Saini one, Thakur one, Natarajan also on debut, all credit to them. After Adelaide we didn't discuss about what happened, we just wanted to play our game, show good attitude, show good character on the field. It was all about the team effort. I would also like to thank our fans who came out here and supported us, and the Indian team would like to give Nathan Lyon a signed jersey for his 100th Test match.""
Tim Paine
: ""Absolutely disappointed. We came here to win the Test and win the series, it's been a bit of a trend that we were found wanting in the key moments and completely outplayed by a tough Indian side that fully deserves the win. I think there's lots of things we'll look back at, but what's done is done. We need to look forward now, there's a big series in South Africa coming up, we've been outplayed by the better side in this series. I think we got about what we wanted in the end. We wanted to set a bit over 300, dangle a carrot to win the Test match and win the series. We might have had another 20 overs had it not rained. But India turned up and put their bodies on the line. [Reviews] are part of the job. sometimes they work, sometimes they don't. But all credit to India, our bowlers threw everything at them.""
Pat Cummins is the player of the series
. ""Good hard day of Test cricket today, I thought Rishabh and the whole Indian side played fantastically, took the game on and deserved the win. I would have liked the cracks to play a few more tricks, but it was a pretty good wicket. Once you were in, it was pretty free-flowing, the runs. I thought today and in Sydney the game was ours to win on day five, but we didn't take enough wickets, but overall happy [with my performance].""
Rishabh Pant is the man of the match
. ""This is one of the biggest moments of my life now, and I'm happy that all the support staff and all my teammates supported me even when I wasn't playing,"" he says. ""It's been a dream series. The team management always backs me and tells me, you are a matchwinner and you have to go win the match for the team. I keep thinking every day that I want to win matches for India, and I did it today. It was a fifth-day pitch and the ball was turning a bit. I thought I have to be disciplined with my shot selection.""

The robot itself runs on two So-101 units, which I control using two additional So-101s.
On the software side, I’m using Phosphobot’s program to handle everything.
For those curious about the head and control system: it’s based on a design by YouTuber MaxImagination, originally intended for RC cars — I described it in more detail in my last post.
The arms are still a bit shaky, and the robot tends to swing, which makes the camera feed a little shaky as well — but those are problems for another time.
I’ll keep you posted with further progress!",

after a lot of work (starting with zero knowledge), im glad that it's walking. the inverse kinematics is very general, so i can adapt it to any hexapod dimensions and i can easily design new gaits.
the next steps will be to continue to refine the firmware, spend (EVEN MORE) money to make it battery powered, add remote control and polish the design a bit.
im really proud of achieving this as a beginner, but constructive criticism is still welcome.",

The Incident:
The vehicle navigated
just a few feet
from officers during a tense standoff while a suspect was on the ground.
The Failure:
The planner technically worked (it didn't hit anyone) but it completely failed to read the room. It highlights that
current AVs
have zero concept of danger or social context beyond basic geometry.
Outcome:
Passengers were safe, but officers had to shout commands at a car that couldn't understand the urgency.

The Robot Learning Company
. My startup was
backed by Y Combinator

As the company name suggests, I spent a lot of time on robot learning (specifically imitation learning from human demonstrations via teleoperation). During this time I worked with a lot of different robots (UR, Fanuc, ARX, Trossen etc.) and realized that none of them can be effectively used for robot learning without significant changes to their hardware or software.
This is why I built

The Tech Stack:
Autonomy:
Uses LiDAR and RTK-GNSS for path planning with
±2.5 cm precision
. It handles the entire cycle: ploughing, seeding, spraying and harvesting without a driver.
Smart Sensing:
Beyond just driving, it collects real-time data on
soil composition, moisture, and crop health
while running.
Powertrain:
Pure electric with a
dual-motor
setup (separating traction from the PTO/farming implements) for better load control.
Endurance:
Runs for
6 hours
on a single charge and coordinates via a 5G mesh network.
""Agri-Robotics""
is where we are seeing the first massive wave of real world autonomy. If a single person can manage a fleet of these from a tablet, it fundamentally changes the economics of small to medium farms.

Mehdi Alizadeh
and thought it was a brilliant example of upcycling.
Most hobby robots require buying separate expensive modules (Microcontroller, IMU, Vision Camera, WiFi Module). This project replaces all of that with a single used smartphone.
Why it's smart engineering:
Active Stabilization:
As seen in the video, it uses the phone's internal IMU (Accelerometer/Gyro) to keep the chassis perfectly level, even while walking.
Compute:
It leverages the phone's CPU/GPU to handle the Inverse Kinematics (IK) and gait calculations.
Vision & Comms:
It gets high-res cameras, GPS and WiFi/Cellular connectivity for free.
It essentially turns e-waste into a high-performance robot controller.

She works full time as a self employed blogger and I wanted to give her a room she could enjoy working in. I love DIY work, and somehow thought I could completely finish this project in 5 days. While looking after the kids. Wow. Not even close.
She returned just after I got the drywalling completed.

Call a handful of local companies in the area, have them quote us on fishing a 24'x12' rectangle of the basement, review the quotes...and pick one that seemed reasonable.
We wanted nothing special. Nothing lavish. A finished rectangle with lights, outlets, and a durable floor. A rec space for the kids, a place to have movie nights, and a bonus spot for family to stay while in town.
Nope.
Over a dozen calls were met with no shows or no responses, showing up 4 hours late to 5pm appointments, degrading comments about the space, requiring features we didn't want or need (bathroom or wet bar), and 4 quotes over fifty thousand fucking dollars.
Partially out of spite, with zero experience or knowledge on anything 'handy', I started looking into what it may cost and the cost associated with each step along the way.
The number came to just under $7,500
0
in materials, budget tools that I didn't have, truck rentals to get everything to my house, and an electrician friend to handle the lights and outlets.
I put everything on paper, convinced my (hesitant) wife to let me try, and decided to give it ago.
For the last 4 months I've spent pretty much every second of free time (and what wasn't supposed to be free time) working on the space, watching how-to's on Youtube, and combing through reddit threads and online forums.
Watching it start to come together was an incredible feeling. Building confidence with each step was extremely rewarding.
Last Friday the couch arrived and we held out first movie night.
Edit: This got way more attention than I ever would have expected. Thank you all for the kind words.

The first few pics are the day I got the house back.  (I don't have a picture of the bathroom from that day, so I added one from the day I bought the house).
I did a full remodel myself.  Framing, wall/removal & beam install, insulation, tile, cabinets, countertops, kitchen/bathroom flooring, plumbing, electric, new LED lighting & fixtures, appliances (purchased and repaired from FB marketplace), vanity, toilet, reglaze tub, furnishings, and more.
The only things I didn't DIY were paint and refinishing the hardwoods.  I've done those before, and I know my limitations.
The one major improvement that doesn't show in the pictures is the smell.  The whole placed reeked of dog pee.  I ran an industrial dehumidifier for two weeks, and an ozone machine for another week.  I also used deodorizing floor cleaner, before having the floors sanded and sealed.
Very happy with how this turned out.  It'll be a mid-term rental for traveling nurses, because it's 1/4 mile from a major hospital.
I didn't do a great job tracking my expenses, but total cost was in the $9k-$11k range.","['https://preview.redd.it/d60w1ajdax6e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=7190de62008d97f5518e3a29c8cf4f07695d4576', 'https://preview.redd.it/hn5lcaodax6e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=5d179b4e79824c5615d342bb39ff227603b8754e', 'https://preview.redd.it/no1y6zrdax6e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=5565f894d736c3111265330289f564e9f4eeb849', 'https://preview.redd.it/2ve680vdax6e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=8c7f83d9122c6b67a58dd65a42a19c57a640660b', 'https://preview.redd.it/s9ikj1ydax6e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=d1d43272bb9cb6e82ea1ad7c19208b357c19ffdd', 'https://preview.redd.it/3htyz11eax6e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=9fe39b56646a98caa5242f8f8c58d46103851d17', 'https://preview.redd.it/veam634eax6e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=d9df58aa122fb4b1666349c2433b2f79ed96899e', 'https://preview.redd.it/xfgijs8eax6e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=85aef9377d71899d7daa3fa76afddb5ad9c5c007', 'https://preview.redd.it/sj9md5deax6e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=35f9389d9bc7d3ffc0710e3629c8a4c64a1774a8', 'https://preview.redd.it/ozi2btheax6e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=5d6c2add973a7c89a27e5c4373072800f652285b', 'https://preview.redd.it/jw3u1wleax6e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=6e08f1930e6fc917efbacc196fc2eae802b10803', 'https://preview.redd.it/lcvktzoeax6e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=03a6aeca5f69b53efd2e717fb8ca2c18c9598d42', 'https://preview.redd.it/d6ihavseax6e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=581f9787e1727540479159ef48c932f842184cfa', 'https://preview.redd.it/5yd7nyveax6e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=845aa995b777a399958a104c1383b5603427ca18', 'https://preview.redd.it/ji03930fax6e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=9d0f2175f273fcb41596346d144db0ce25f12649', 'https://preview.redd.it/ykp44v2fax6e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=16f9864e1839c05b67ba9e13471a7e7334438d4a', 'https://preview.redd.it/81qpr85fax6e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=eaac611616318addd1d5282d090473f4df251ef5', 'https://preview.redd.it/g5pnzf8fax6e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=66f9f8859f4bdc14c0bd7e7a348db0070662960c', 'https://preview.redd.it/2phrkwafax6e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=8a18a878c9a971290977fed18a18f70bd32dc9f0', 'https://preview.redd.it/qr60a6efax6e1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=4342102b8c7e0652c372f6231398de8e4b4e8af0']"

DIY,https://old.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/1flx4ms/refinished_100_year_old_hardwood_floors_turned/,15042,174,Refinished 100 year old hardwood floors. Turned out better than I hoped.,"Just bought an old house. Pulled up nasty carpet, found some very beat up hardwoods and decided to try my hand at refinishing.
Rented a drum sander and an edge sander first and took off a thick layer of old varnish and spray paint. Started with 36 grit and worked up to 100. Then went back and swapped for a walk-behind orbital sander to smooth the transition between the edges and the center. There were tons of deep scratches from dragging heavy furniture across the floor, as well as deep discoloration, wine stains, you name it. Much of it came out but not all.
Used a variety of cleaners including Bona with some hydrogen peroxide to get most of the stains out. Then did two coats of Minwax oil based poly with some light color, and then about 4 more coats of oil based Varathane poly. After each coat, went over the whole thing first gently shaving off any uneven areas with a paint scraper where the varnish had pooled, then roughing the surface with steel wool and then later 220 grit, before wiping down with tack cloth to remove dust. One mistake was using small foam rollers. They left a lot of tracks that were hard to smooth out, but I bought a bunch of them so stuck it out.
Rental costs were about $200. Materials probably $300-400 for rollers, rags, tack cloth, sandpaper, and 4 cans of poly for about 500 square feet of floor.","['https://preview.redd.it/vlb7tkpf14qd1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=022a62977f2b43c27d77223290f5c7dc3b80fc47', 'https://preview.redd.it/p3etnkpf14qd1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=2925f9f25bbbc4553ad457e3907cc3f0e03df32d', 'https://preview.redd.it/9fntakpf14qd1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=dac6802f0de8627438f002a31b6a9d221191d346', 'https://preview.redd.it/8hysakpf14qd1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=96811788d3971b90e5c13826f046fb9979df5348', 'https://preview.redd.it/schc9mpf14qd1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=fc4a794b04f0f00dbde02c07b04c145301105b57', 'https://preview.redd.it/ca2e7kpf14qd1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=1d1c2e729e4746c51971bca465d73ea7e8463e74', 'https://preview.redd.it/p5063kpf14qd1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=5bd71f869445dda68f3652dbdfcf54ca4813e27b', 'https://preview.redd.it/4zs17kpf14qd1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=4c8d8831286d9404a22ca356b4037990b9870db9', 'https://preview.redd.it/qarvokpf14qd1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=604b4e924b05b8e5a09986b43a8cc798ed36f2a3', 'https://preview.redd.it/hrxw4kpf14qd1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=5600ee1dedbc936b5723fb99babb2ff7a856fff9', 'https://preview.redd.it/omrnskpf14qd1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=9b81ceda58e768292419c5b4faa860e4828ec34e', 'https://preview.redd.it/1rvrvjqf14qd1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=120b62febb3831884e3c655ebcd8db96bfe5b93b', 'https://preview.redd.it/pyonwlpf14qd1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=109ed8a80aaf60c831402e59da757e4d992e4fe3']"

We have come to learn some very sad news recently,
u/bossgalaga
, the founder of
r/Explainlikeimfive
, has unfortunately passed away. In his honor we wanted to post the links of two charities that were dear to him:
The Immune Deficiency Foundation
The Institute for Effective Education
We are forever grateful for what he has created and hope you will consider supporting charitable organizations as he did.  As our regulars may recognize this post is out of character for us but as a mod team we felt these circumstances were unique. This post will stay up for a week, and we will include links to those charities in our wiki.
Additionally, it has come to our attention that
u/bossgalaga
made a post in
/r/askreddit
on July 28th, 2011 (ten years ago yesterday) asking if people would be interested in a sub dedicated to, ""...ask(ing) questions that some people might find obvious -- and to do so without fear of being downvoted, made fun of, or ignored."" This, of course, led to the start of

fitness,https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4pl3yc/things_i_wish_i_knew_8_years_ago/,19489,653,Things I Wish I Knew 8 Years Ago,"I've been seriously lifting weights for eight years now. Looking back at when I first started, I did so many things wrong but it took me a lot of trial and error to get where I'm at today. By no means do I know everything now -- not even close. I finished school with a BS in Kinesiology and got my CSCS from the National Strength and Conditioning Association, and will start my Master's program in the fall. There have been many times where I was dead-set on being right about things, only to later find out I was wrong.
That's the beauty of exercise and strength training: continuing to learn and grow. You should never be complacent with what you know. Buy books, read articles, ask around your gym. You can only benefit from this. You can add to what you already have in your arsenal and become a complete package. Here are some things I wish I knew when I started 8 years ago. (Disclaimer: this is mainly directed at beginners, but some of these things may be new to you even if you've been lifting for some time)
Just because your numbers are going up doesn't mean you're doing the exercise right.
I remember hitting plenty of milestones in regards to benching, squatting, and deadlifting. However, I would later find out little things I was doing wrong that could have led to injury. Fixing these minor tweaks made the exercises much harder, but I felt much stronger and safer because of them.
Mobility work is extremely important.
After a couple years of lifting, I was at the top of the world. I was bigger, stronger, had more confidence, etc. However, I didn't realize how tight I was, and how that was restricting much of what I did in the weight room and in my life. If you don't know much about mobility, do some research. Thoracic spine mobility, shoulder mobility, hip mobility, ankle mobility, the list goes on and on. Look up people like Kelly Starrett, Eric Cressey, Matthew Ibraham, and others. They all have YouTube channels and their attention to detail in regards to range of motion, stability, and mobility are some of the most useful and eye-opening pieces of information you can find.
Never underestimate the power of warming up.
I see a lot of people walk into the gym, do a couple of shoulder circles, then jump into their workout. I used to do the same thing. However, once I started adding in dynamic warmups and prehab/mobility exercises before lifting, I noticed a world's difference. Consider the exercises you'll be doing that day and work on those areas before you hit the weights.
Compound movements really do trump all.
This was a hard lesson for me to learn. I used to do the typical back/biceps, chest/triceps, shoulders/traps, legs split (which, depending on your goals, isn't necessarily a bad thing). However, once I switched over to Push/Pull/Leg splits, I really noticed a change in my body. Cut down the isolation work. Focus on exercises that will truly challenge your strength, stability, and coordination. Pull ups, chin ups, bent over rows, squats, deadlifts, RDLs, overhead presses, bench/incline bench, pushups, dips, cleans, snatches, etc. Those are the exercises that should make up the majority of your workouts. Find ways to make them harder if you've already mastered them. Not only will your strength increase, but you'll look even better.
The best core work you can do (in terms of both safety and results) doesn't involve crunches and russian twists
Just hear me out on this one. I used to do the usual ab exercises -- sit ups, crunches, leg raises, russian twists, side bends, etc. While these will all work your abs, they do little to nothing to help your overall core stability. Start using movements that will help you in your other lifts (and they will strengthen and grow your abs as well). These movements refer to anti-extension/flexion, anti-rotation, rotational movements, etc. I've been doing these exercises for my core and have noticed my other lifts improve because of them (in addition to being extremely sore the next day): Hanging leg raises, Pallof presses, landmine rotations, woodchops, planks on a stability ball, rollouts (wheel or stability ball), dead bugs, bird dogs, back extensions, dragonfly's, rotational throws, plank slides with gliders, side planks, farmer carries, overhead carries, L sits, etc. A lot of these can be done on one knee or can be made harder by taking away an arm or leg. Basically, any exercise that challenges your body's ability to stay stable has a profound effect on your overall strength and still give you that ab soreness that so many people desire (even though that's not what we're after..but you know what I'm saying). Another note on this: people tend to think of the ""core"" as just your abs. But your core is actually all of the structures that support your trunk and limbs. This includes your abdominals, obliques, shoulder joints, hip joints, lower back muscles, etc. By strengthening these areas, you improve your trunk rigidity. When your trunk rigidity increases, it allows more freedom of movement from your limbs. All proximal tightness will improve distal ROM.
Kettlebells are AWESOME
I avoided kettlebells for a very long time up until these past few years. Talk about a game-changer. Kettlebells allow you to do some crazy movements that'll challenge your body in ways that you didn't think possible. Kettlebell swings are towards the top of my list. Not only are they great for glute strength/power, but it has a carryover effect for teaching proper hip hinge mechanics, and is a great tool to add in for high intensity conditioning. Turkish get ups, windmills, clean and presses, one-armed presses, goblet squats (great for beginners), and many other exercises challenge you in a unique way. If you haven't tried training with kettlebells, I recommend you start now.
Cardio really, really, really does not have to be a drag
I know a lot of people have recently moved away from the long duration treadmill, elliptical, stair-stepper, and biking trend that has dominated the fitness culture for so long. But a lot of people still limit themselves to just that. Circuits and HIIT are truly superior if you want to add in cardio work. Not only is it faster, but it's way less boring and much more fun and effective. Some ideas of exercises to use for your conditioning: PROWLER PUSHES, kettlebell swings, rower intervals, ball slams (both front and side to side), plyometric work, speed ladders, tire flips, mountain climbers, box jumps, sprints, battle ropes, jump ropes, sled pulls (with a rope, working primarily your back), etc. These will not only leave you gassed but also work your entire body instead of just your legs. The possibilities are endless.
Writing out, or following, a detailed workout program will get you to that next level
I can't tell you how many of my workouts in years past consisted of me walking into the gym and meandering from exercise to exercise. Sure I walked out with a nice pump, but how did I know I actually made any progress. When I follow a pre-written routine, I go into the gym on a mission. I know what I'm going to do, how many times, and how much weight I'll use. This really drills discipline into you. Some days you come in feeling sluggish, but if you have a routine set up, you know that you must finish what you wrote down. Otherwise, you'd probably cut your workout short. Having a specific goal changes your mindset completely. Tracking your progress keeps you honest and prepared. Looking back on your numbers and seeing them increase is an awesome feeling. Look into programs like 5/3/1, starting strength, PHAT, just to name a few. Or, if you feel competent enough, write up your own. Take progress pictures. Track your numbers. It is essential for success.
Learn your damn anatomy.
A lot of things really started clicking for me once I began studying anatomy and physiology. Although it may be boring, once you learn about where each bone is, where your muscles originate and insert, how the contraction process takes place, etc. then you will start viewing lifting in a whole new light. Biomechanics is a big one too. These things can change how you lift and help you pay more attention to your technique. For instance, you know you need to keep your elbows back to target your triceps during dips, but do you know WHY? Did you know that your pec actually inserts onto your humerus (arm bone) therefore when you keep your arms close you're essentially taking the pec out of [majority of] the movement? Not only will this help you, but it will help if someone ever needs advice or has any ""why"" questions. Do your muscles flex? Well, no they don't. Your joints flex and extend. Your muscles contract and relax. Find out the function of each muscle, what muscles contribute to elbow/shoulder/hip/knee extension and flexion, and you'll learn a lot of new things. Look up websites like getbodysmart.com which have great illustrations of muscle function and placement.
Nutrition and sleep really are as important as people make them out to be.
I know, I know. Everyone has heard this by now. But I had to mention it. Just google the benefits of sleep if you don't know them, but they are substantial. Nutrition..well, I could write an entire essay on that subject alone but you must, and I mean MUST make this a priority over everything else. If you have your nutrition on point, everything else will come with relative ease. Don't undermine its importance.
Breathing mechanics are important.
This is one that I've really had to learn to incorporate lately. And I'm not talking about the typical ""exhale when exerting/using concentric contractions and inhale during lowering/eccentric contractions. I'm talking about proper breathing and rib alignment. Google or YouTube proper breathing mechanics and setup. 90/90 breathing is a great exercise to use. Most of us here are chest breathers, when in reality we need to be using our diaphragms. This will change the way you do pretty much every exercise.
Film yourself.
I'm adding this one a day late because it totally slipped my mind last night. There's a difference between what you feel like you're doing and what you're ACTUALLY doing. The best way to find out the truth is to film yourself from the side. This is such a big help, especially if you're wondering how your form is. Try to have a friend film you squat or deadlift in slow motion, and watch the video carefully. Look at how you initiate the movement, if/when you start rounding your back, how your head position looks, etc. Or, you can even film yourself doing these exercises in your room with no weight. Although it may sound weird, doing certain exercises with a shirt off will actually show you the muscles themselves moving, and if you do an exercise from a rear view you can see your spinal mechanics at work. It's really an interesting thing to do and will help you spot any errors and correct your form.
That's all I could think of for now, but I'm sure there's a lot more. I figured if it was longer than this I'd lose your attention (unless I already lost you a long time ago).
Like I said earlier, by no means do I know everything. Not even close. But in order to be the best you can be in the world of physical fitness, you must continue to learn and experiment. Be proud of where you are, but ask yourself what aspects you're ignoring or could improve. Much love

fitness,https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/7ye7r2/how_to_do_pull_ups_properly_and_how_to_do_your/,14127,512,How to do PULL UPS properly and how to do your first pullup if you can't do any. 💪,"Hi everybody, Antranik here. I created these two videos recently to improve upon the
r/bodyweightfitness Recommended Routine (""RR"")
and I'm sharing them here as well. The link is in the header and the summary is below them.
1.
Video: How to do Proper Pullups
There are two phases of a pullup: The scapular pull in the beginning (with straight arms) and then the actual pullup.  This can be done in one fluid motion but if you take a video of yourself and find your shoulders remain shrugged up
or
if you can barely get the chin-over, you should consciously focus on improving your scapular pull.
Also, make sure you're
going down ALL THE WAY
and NOT doing half-ROM pullups which are
super
common. Another tip is to keep your feet uncrossed, thighs together and in front of you as it will make you stronger.
2.
Video: How to do pullups if you can't do any
In part two, I demonstrate how to
perform negative pullups properly,
emphasizing
the importance of lifting/tucking the knees up as you lower down so that your feet dont hit the ground before your arms are straight.
Your goal is to do 10-second negatives.
If you can't control the negative, then you need to work on your rows (incline rows to be exact) which are an easier pulling exercise and a prerequisite for pullups. In the RR, we recommend you get to 3 sets of 8 reps (""3x8"") of horizontal rows before moving to the pullup progression.
If you are unsure how or where to do rows, review the video on
bodyweight rows here

The Stretches
Upper Body (
Video
)
Shoulder Backbend
| The shoulder backbend focuses on shoulder overhead flexibility. This is important for many weightlifting exercises, but also for handstands and hand-balancing. It is also important for shoulder health, especially when older. Stand up with a straight bodyline, tense your butt muscles and move your arms overhead. Move your arms backwards without losing the straight bodyline. (
Video
)
Spine Backbend
| The spine backbend focuses on thoracic spine mobility. If you ever dreamt of doing bridges on the floor, this is your exercise. A good thoracic spinal mobility can be progressed into all kinds of
fancy exercises
. Place your palms (or fingertips) on your shoulderblades and tense your butt. Now lean back without arching your lower back and move the arms. You can bend the knees a little. (
Video
)
Rear Hand Clasp
| Did you ever want to scratch your back but couldn't reach the spot because you lacked behind-the-back flexibility? This is your exercise. It's good for your shoulderblades and to counter long sitting periods. This stretch is very important for upper body posture aswell! Get into a straight bodyline. Take a towel, a band or a t-shirt and grab both ends with your arms. One arm is overhead and one is behind the back. The upper arm pulls the lower arm gently into the stretch. Pull upwards. (
Video
)
Lying Cross
| The lying cross is a stretch that is aimed at people with poor posture. Start on all fours and move one arm below the other arm until your shoulder
touches the floor.
To deepen the stretch, lay down on the floor and extend the non-stretched arm to the front. (
Video
)
Wrist-Biceps Stretch
| This stretch works on your wrist flexibility and stretches your forearms, your biceps and your deltoid muscles. Stand next to a wall and place your palms on it. Fingers pointing backwards. Now straighten your arm and twist your upper body to the opposite direction. (
Video
)
Lower Body (
Video
)
One-Leg Pike
| This stretches your hamstrings. Most people that sit on a computer all day have tight hamstrings, because those muscles are very tensed in a chair-sitting position. When you stretch them regularily, you can take load off your lower back. Flexible hamstrings progress into
the pike stretch
. Place your foot on a chair and lean forward with a straight back. If you're advanced enough to touch your toes with a straight back (!), then you can progress to the
standing version of the stretch.
(
Video
)
Kneeling Lunge
| The kneeling lunge works on your hamstrings, your quads and your hip muscles like the iliopsoas. This is the most important stretch to gain flexibility for the
front splits
. Place one foot in front of you and extend it slowly with a straight back. Use your hands to balance yourself properly. (
Video
)
Pancake
| The pancake stretches your hamstrings and your leg adductors. With strong leg adductors, you will have it much easier in martial arts and all dance moves. It also
looks really cool
in the full progression. Sit on the floor with a straight back and extend the legs to both sides. Lean forward. (
Video
)
Butterfly
| A strong butterfly is a prequisite for
the lotus sit.
Sit on the floor with a straight back and move your soles together. Grab them with your hands and gently pull forward with a straight back. Try to bring your knees to the floor. If that's not yet possible, feel free to place a pillow under your knees. (
Video
)
Calf Stretch
| Many people neglect their calf muscles, although it is necessary to give your calves some love. Tight calves love to cramp and hurt. It can prevent heel spurs and all kind of degenerative feet diseases to regularily stretch and strengthen your feet muscles. Grab something and bend one knee forward. Extend the back leg and try to push the heel into the ground. (

Frequently Asked Questions
Why didn't you include [insert stretch]?!
Starting To Stretch is meant to give you the best ""bang for your buck"" and focuses on the most common problem areas. Feel free to insert your own specific stretch into the program!
How often should i do this program?
A good starting point would be two times a week. If you have the time, do it three times a week! If you lack time, split it up into upper and lower body and do both once a week.
Can i do this every day?
Absolutely! However, if you feel pain or discomfort, do it a bit less. Your muscles need rest too and stretching is taxing your nervous system quite hard.
I have medical condition [insert here], can i do the program?
There's no one-size-fits-all answer for this one. Ask on the subreddit and people will make sure to help you with your specific problem.
When should i do the program?
Any time when you are relatively stress free is perfect. When your mind is relaxed, stretching is easier. Don't do it before a workout, because it increases injury risk. After a workout is fine!
I don't like this stretch: [insert stretch], can i replace it with something else?
Absolutely! You won't benefit from stretches that you don't do, because you hate them. Switch them up as much as you like and need.

fitness,https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3qft9h/smoking_increases_risk_of_lung_cancer_2500_bacon/,13331,1214,"Smoking increases risk of lung cancer 2,500%. Bacon increases risk of colon cancer 18%. (Followup to yesterday's meat/cancer WHO post.)","According to this article in Wired
, processed and cooked meat does increase risk of colon cancer, but far less than smoking cigarettes increases risk of lung cancer.
The scientific evidence linking both processed meat and tobacco to certain types of cancer is strong. In that sense, both are carcinogens. But smoking increases your relative risk of lung cancer by 2,500 percent; eating two slices of bacon a day increases your relative risk for colorectal cancer by 18 percent. Given the frequency of colorectal cancer, that means your risk of getting colorectal cancer over your life goes from about 5 percent to 6 percent and, well, YBMMV. (Your bacon mileage may vary.) “If this is the level of risk you’re running your life on, then you don’t really have much to worry about,” says Alfred Neugut, an oncologist and cancer epidemiologist at Columbia.
The same tiny risk profile appears to be present for other red meats.
Anyway, the article is worth a read. And if you are a smoker, quitting is still the #1 thing you can do for your health.
EDIT:
Smoking also is correlated with colorectal cancers
and you can
lower your risk for colon cancer by exercising, losing weight, drinking less alcohol, eating more fiber in the form of whole grains and vegetables
, and getting regular screening after the age of 50. A vegetarian diet was associated with a 22% lower risk for colon cancer in one study, but
a pescatarian diet was even lower at 43% reduced risk
, probably due to the Vitamin D and Omega 3 fatty acids.
EDIT2: And just for even more perspective,
30-60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical exercise daily may reduce colon cancer risk by 30-40% according to the National Cancer Institute.",

This will be my final post on this unless something major happens in the future. Once again, I want to thank
/r/Fitness
for all the support you've given me this past year, I truly appreciate it and hope I can repay it in kind.
Just-Show-me-the-Photos...
Before/After Photos
TL;DWTR (aka I've got a minute, give me the juicy details):
So, it has been 1 year since I hit my 200lbs loss, ~9 months since I got below 200lbs for the first time in my adult life, and just over 6 months since I underwent skin removal surgery where the removed ~244 sq inches of skin. To make it short, it has been one crazy year. This post is both an update for all of the above, plus an update on my diet/exercise plan (as per the rules).
The surgery went well, but as you can see from the photos I'm kind of lopsided. My right side did not turn out as well as my left. As far as weight, I have maintained my 200lbs weight loss throughout the entire surgery, recovery and now as I work to regain what strength/muscle I lost.
Below is a VERY abbreviated backstory, the original is still
available here
and the second
update is here
​
Quick Background:
I won't rehash the whole story again as the original posts from last year are still available, links below.
​When I was a kid I was told I would never be fat. By the time I graduated from High School I was ~320lbs. Starting my Junior year of college I moved to main campus, weighing about 390, and reached 400+ by end of the 1st year on campus. Second year on campus was when I reached my recorded max of 407.8lbs. It is likely that I weighed more, but the 407.8 figure is the highest I found logged by a medical office, so it is the one I use.
Diet:
For the 2 years I have stuck to IIFYM, which is, in my humble opinion, the best out of the options I've personally tried. Approximately, 1800-1900 cals/day cutting. After the surgery I was told I had to eat, so I reverse dieted to 2000 to aid recovery. But this translated into ""eat all the foods"" since I didn't really have anything else to do. This did put some fat back on me since all I could do was sit and walk short distances. But I did maintain the 200lbs loss for a year now and have never crossed back into that.
I shoot for 130g of food-based protein, minimum, regardless of diet or supplementation. Even on cheat days. But I usually get more like 180g a day.
Fat is usually under 45g/day, carbs make up the rest.
Typical Meals:
Breakfast:
60g Oatmeal sweetened w/ Splenda, 4 piece of toast from Heiner's 35 calorie bread
Pre-Workout:
Large Apple
Lunch:
8oz chicken breast, 250g sweet potato.
Protein Bar
Rarely, but I prefer ones that don't go under a 10cal:1g protein ratio. (eg. 200cal bar w/ 20g protein)
Dinner:
6-8oz Lean meat, veggies, and I end the day's eating @ 6-7pm with a single serving protein pancake w/ SF syrup. Kodiak Dark Chocolate is hands down the best IMO.
I don't personally believe in supplementation. Just a personal thing. But, I will drink some Myprotein-brand BCAAs after a particularly difficult workout, but nothing else. I do occasionally use protein powder, but it is usually to cook with, not drink, and when I do get some it is usually Myprotein or ON brand.
Exercise:
My approach to fitness, given my age, is functional with a heavy slant on looking decent. I would like to have abs just one time in my life, just to look like the classic ""male."" However, over the last few weeks I have realized that I just wasn't putting my all into it. I realize that, technically, I am still recovering from a massive surgery where the front of my body was split in twain. But, I never get sore anymore, I rarely mix up my exercises. I didn't add in new ones. I did a strict split and just tried to put up more weight. I told myself that
insert exercises I was good at
exercises is what I could do due to
insert BS excuse here
and never pushed forward.
Then I met a good friend of mine, who is 18 years old. 21 years my junior, a local soccer star, cross country State finalist, and still hits the gym everyday. He pushes me harder than anyone I have ever met, refuses the ""nonsense"" of my age until I have actually tried something new. It reminds me of my niece who always says ""I don't like that"" when you offer something new to eat. For me it's ""Im too old/weak/recovering for that."" He doesn't accept that until I have tried. If I could give any tip to someone new to this fitness/weight loss world it would be to find someone who doesn't take excuses. Not because you are paying them, but because they honestly know you well enough to see past the excuses, to see the person you could be.
Over the last few weeks I have been fine tuning a new program, it is still in progress but this is pretty close to the final plan. The idea was to move away from a regular split to something that mimicked a 2 day/wk split while making it accessible for someone who doesn't have the recovery ability of a 20 year old. Plus, adding in more functional movements and core to each day versus a dedicated day.
Each day is a Heavy/Light split, the Heavy area being the main focus of the day and the Light being a secondary day, but no reduction in weight, just a reduced number of exercises.
Split:
I don't have a set rep/set pattern for any exercise other than
10 reps for the first 2 sets of any exercise, then all additional sets are to failure.
Average range of sets is 4-8, depending on the exercise, weight, etc.
Monday
is Heavy Chest / Light Back + Chinups, Pushups, 3x Core Exercises
Tuesday
is Heavy Core / Light Legs + Pushups, Chinups, 2x Bicep Exercises
Weds
is Heavy Back / Light Chest +  Pushups, Vacuums, 2x Core Exercises
Thursday
is Deadlifts, Rackpulls, Pullovers, Pushups, 3x Core Exercises, Chinups
Friday
is Heavy Shoulders / Light Arms + Pushups, Asst. Pullups, 3x Core exercises
Sat
is Heavy Legs (focused) then Light Full Body (more or less I workout various things, all to failure, while I chat and enjoy the day) + Iso Bicep Exercises
Sun
is Rest Day
Breakdown of Exercises:
Chest:
Chest Press (Machine), Landmine Press, Sven Press, Flat Bench, Incline Bench
Back:
Machine Rows, Lat Pulldown, T-bar Row, Iso Low-Row, Cable Mid-Row, Lat Pressdown, Australian Pullups, DB Shrugs, I/T/Y/Ws, DB Rows, Lumbar Hyperextensions, Robbery Exercise w/ 20lb DBs
Core:
Core Twist, Flutter Kicks, Reverse Crunches, Oblique Crunches, V holds, V Ball Passes, Ab-Pullovers, Hanging Leg Lift, L-Sit, Roman Chair Crunches
Legs:
High Bar Squat, Goblet Squat, Air Squat, Barbell Calf Press, Leg Extensions, Glute Kickback Machine, Hamstring Curls, Glute Thrusts, Abd/Add Press, Leg Press
Shoulders:
DB Scap Holds, Dislocations, DB OHP, BB OHP, Lateral Raises, Plate Raises, Plate Steering (use a plate like a steering wheel)
Bicep/Tricep:
Standing DB Curl, Preacher Curls, Iso DB Curls, Cable Curls, Drag Curls, Hammer Curls, Tricep Pushdown, Tricep Cable Extension, Internal/External Rotator Cuff Cable Pulls
Again, these are all the same format.
10 reps for 2 sets, then everything else to failure with no hard set range.
Average is 4-8 sets, depends on exercise, weight, etc. Deadlifts are the odd man out, it is 5 reps each set, no set limits, just until I can't do it anymore or form breaks down. Usually it's 6-10 sets depending on weight progression.
The Mods asked me to elaborate on the weight progression of my fitness plan. Given my age I'm not really chasing the same dreams that the younger people are so my progression is more tailored to overall fitness. When I start a new exercise I find a weight that I can do 4-6 sets with, to failure each set, and that is where I start. However, this is not a hard and fast rule, some days as I start increasing the weight through the sets I get worn out and don't progress in weight that week. My goal is to push to failure each and every time. Overall I feel this gives a better workout for me and seems to still allow decent recovery.
As an example, I logged my previous deadlift day.
Set 1:
95lbs x 21 reps
Set 2:
115lbs x 17reps
Set 3:
135lbs x 13reps
Set 4:
185lbs x 10reps
Set 5:
205lbs x 6 reps
Set 6:
235lbs x 4 reps
Set 7:
235lbs x 3 reps
I do log my workouts, but I don't track # of reps. I only track that I did a set to failure, how many sets I did total, and the maximum weight used. This is done by putting an X or a dot next to exercise which denotes a completed set. Then at the end I write down the maximum weight used across the exercise.
Cardio:
I have slowly added in either
sprint cardio
(Sprints on the Treadmill Usually) or some
long slow cardio
(Stair Climber is still my favorite). I do this
3-4 days a week and I do at least 2x 2-minute Sprints every day but Saturday.
I also do rehab-given exercises for shoulders, knees, and back to maintain the health of those areas. Those are just peppered in throughout the week. I won't list these here,
if you have an injury, see a doctor/physio.
Yes, it is a lot each day. But I tend to thrive on a meticulously laid out plans. Plus, if I over-shoot in the plan, then Ill either overachieve daily or at least hit the mark in execution.
I've only been lifting heavy again for about 2.5 months between the surgery and my shoulder. So these are my horribly weak, Post Recovery Lifts (these are for reps of 3 of more, not 1RM)
Flat bench:
155lbs
Squat:
155lbs
Deadlift:
235lbs
Extras:
I like to hike/backpack, swim for distance, and I run on the rare occasion, but aside from the gym I don't do much in the way of sports.
​
Whats Next:
You can stamp a big ""VAIN"" on my forehead, but I want freaking abs. Just once. Also traps.
My gym mates and I just finished a 6 week ""Add-On"" plan I developed where we did vacuums and pushups every morning. I went from barely being able to do 15 pushups to easily being able to bust out 40-45 in one go. Everyone whined about the vacuums after the first 3 days, but now they are thanking me, it really is an undervalued exercise. Now that is done, I am planning to focus on my posture and my shoulders. I have some kyphosis in the upper back from years of being a computer geek then later a WoW nerd. So, I want to correct my posture as much as I can, which will translate into better, stronger shoulders.
I am also going to have to try and figure out how to get the other 1 or 2 skin removals I will need to look ""normal"". My rear flanks/love-handle area will absolutely need fixed and my chest will likely need to be fixed. Until that point, I will continue to lose fat and get as functionally strong as I can get.
FAQ
Are you going to lose any more weight?
My plastic surgeon has recommended I go down to 185, but no lower. At that point I should be focused on more of a recomp. As you can see from the pictures, there is still fat under the skin. I need to get rid of as much of that as I can.
Did you have surgery or use any drugs/medicine/chemicals?
​No. Nothing against them, I just feel the ""quick"" (but, clearly not painless) methods available lack a certain educational value to them. Sure, I can teach someone the techniques to keep off the 100lbs they lost from weight loss surgery, but actually living it for years, dealing with failures/obstacles, is nearly always the best teacher.
What's next?
I'd still like to climb a mountain. Maybe Mt. Rainier or Mt. Elbert?​ Something with proper snow and requires a bit of technical climbing.​ I'v​e ​always been a bit of an armchair mountaineer. A friend of mine climbed Kilimanjaro about a year after a dual cervical fusion, plus he is 12 years older than me, so what is and isn't possible for me kind of has been thrown out the window.
Did you ever consider suicide?
I put this on every update I do, or anything I post connected with weight loss. The answer is yes I have, on a few occasions, not my finest moments.
If you are considering suicide, PLEASE get help, there are lots of options for help, regardless of where you are in the world. You might think suicide will stop what you are currently feeling, but it also robs you of everything you could be. In the US you can call 1-800-273-8255, 911, or go to the nearest Emergency Room. Also,

my progress pictures
on
/r/Brogress
yesterday, I got so many nice comments that I thought to write about this journey in more detail here.
Initial motivation
My starting weight was 62kg (137lbs) and height 185cm (6'1"") at 20 years old, I didn't grow taller but I grew my physique and the way I live.
I always wanted to go to the gym, I browsed
4chan's /fit/
/r/fitness
and
/r/bodybuilding
a lot but never really got around to it. There was a gym in my town but it was quite expensive €65 per month for 1 free weight area and a stupid
milon circle?
..
Moving to England
Almost 2 years ago, I moved to the UK (Swindon) and they had a 24 hour gym. I thought, no more excuses and let's go. Browsing reddit and other forums I decided to start with Stronglifts 5x5.
Stronglifts 5x5
This was a great workout to start with, I did it for 3 months straight, never missing a single workout and gained a lot, the beginning is always fast. In those 3 months I went from 62kg (137lbs) to 70kg (155lbs). I got my bench up to 60kg, deadlift 120kg, row 70kg and OHP 45kg. I was
over the moon
, I felt stronger, shirts started to fit tighter and people started to notice slightly
Diet
: My diet at that time consisted of.. eating a ton of food and whole milk (GOMAD). I didn't count calories (still don't) but I always checked what pasta had the most calories, what meat etc. That and the additional 2000kcal I got from drinking 2.5L whole milk a day had me gaining a lot of weight. I stopped doing GOMAD after my skin started to get bad (a lot of pimples) and I had to go to the toilet about every hour.
PHUL
After feeling
fairly
strong and done with Stronglifts, I started
PHUL
. 4 days a week. I did this for about 3 months and again, saw some nice gains. Switching up routines has worked really well for me. After ~3 months I just don't get sore anymore, so I change workouts and then I do. I did this workout up until like 76kg (167lbs).
Diet:
During these 3 months, I again, ate as much as possible. I was completely done with the milk but started taking weight gainer shakes. I bought the
Optimum Nutrition
one and took one before bed, every night.
PHAT
After not getting sore anymore from PHUL, I started
PHAT
. 5 days a week, training hard. I did this for about 4 months and saw decent results. I got up to 80kg (176lbs), my goal weight. You know what happens once you reach your goal? You feel great, but you want more (or at least I do). So the current goal then was (and still is now) 90kg (200lbs).
Diet:
Nothing special, still kept up the weight gainer shakes every night and just ate
a lot
.
Moving back to the Netherlands
My year in England was done, I wanted to move back. It was as if the god Brodin himself wanted me to keep getting gains because in my tiny town, there suddenly was a brand new, shiny
24h
gym. This couldn't be a coincidence.
6 day PPL split
I started with 3 days a week, went up to 4 days a week, moved to 5 days a week so now the most logical next step to me was to go 6 days a week. So I did with this
6 day PPL split
. I had been lifting for almost a year now and people told me I looked like I lift..
Achievement Unlocked
-> Not looking DYEL anymore, finally. So I did this 6 days a week, again never skipping a workout and religiously going, looking forward to every day.
Diet:
Same old, just eat a lot. I moved back with my parents so I don't decide what's for dinner anymore... I got tired of the weight gainer shakes so I found something even better. ""quark"" with wallnuts.  I can't find the direct English word for it but it looks like
this
, it's like really thick yoghurt. One 500ml cup with wallnuts contains about 1050kcal and again, I took one before bed, every night.
Lazar Angelov's workout + Running
I started this workout a month ago, when I was 83kg (182lbs) and I am at the time of writing, 85.5kg (189lbs).
This workout
is a lot of fun and has muscle group days rather than pull / push days. Which is nice after ~10 months doing PPL. Before starting this workout I took a week off lifting because I had been lifting non stop. I hated not lifting and not going to the gym. Every hour I was thinking about the weights, looking at
/r/bodybuilding
, images of Steve Cook and Calum von Moger.. After that week I started the workout and man, I got super sore (again)!
Running
: So my new job was on the 4th floor, I take the elevator every day because Dom told me cardio kills gainz. I took the stairs ""for fun"" once and noticed my endurance sucked big time. Since Lazar's workout is 5 days a week, I got 2 rest days. That's 1 too much so I started running. Just 5-8km every Sunday.
Diet:
Same as with the PPL split, living the quark and wallnuts still.
Supplements
I took protein shakes, BCAAs, ZMA, whatever. None of them longer than 2 weeks because I just didn't dig the shakes. The only supplements I have taken daily and will continue to do so are:
Creatine (3g)
Multivitamin
Fish Oil
I feel like that's all I need, 5 pills when I wake up (multi + fish oil) and 1 scoop of creatine before I go to bed.
Sleep
8 hours a night, every night. I know and feel sleep is important. My new job requires me to get up at 05:45. This is why I am in bed 21:45 Sunday to Thursday. I religiously sleep 8 hours at least and about 8.5-9 in the weekend.
No alcohol
This is an overstatement, I sure drank some pints in England with my colleagues but only 1 night a week. If I drank Friday, I didn't drink on Saturday and vice-versa. I barely drink
any
alcohol nowadays as it just doesn't taste as good anymore. I used to love drinking beer with my friends but now I just drink water, only water.
Conclusion
Starting to lift has been the best decision in my life. I was always that skinny kid with red hair. I was scared of confrontation and I just felt weak. Now 1.5 years later people tell me I'm ""getting big"" and ""starting to look like a closet"" (that probably sounds cooler in Dutch). Someone in that
/r/brogress
thread told me I inspired him (or her). That was really cool to hear. I hope to inspire more people and that's why I wrote this long ass post.
EDIT:
I don't know why my post got locked but I didn't do it. Thanks for the nice PMs everyone and yes I like this manbun for now, I'm not going to cut it off because a few internet strangers tell me to haha!
EDIT2: 
Some of you have asked my Instagram / Snapchat, it's the same as my reddit username but I don't post a lot. Just the occasional gym selfie..
EDIT3: 
So it went kinda viral,
The LAD Bible posted it on Facebook
. My Reddit friends tell me I look like a cool viking and Facebook people call me out on the hair (which I wear because I like it) and are super mean. <3 for you guys.",

So about 2 and half to 3 years ago I weighed about 366lbs. It sucked. I had been fat my entire life and always wanted to change it. I wanted to change because for one its unhealthy to be that size. I had zero confidence. I wanted to be in the military and one day be a police officer or firefighter/paramedic but I wasn't going to get there being fat. There are plenty of reasons I can rattle off for my obesity but it all comes down to laziness and ignorance to nutrition.
So 2.5 years ago my uncle got me into lifting (forcefully lol). We'd lift almost everyday after I got up around 3pm (I worked 3rd shift). We'd lift for a few hours and before I knew it I had to get ready for work soon. So I had only a small window of time to eat and chill out versus waking up and eating/chilling all day then going to work. A month went by and I finally weighed myself. I lost 6 pounds and figured to myself that I might as well keep this up... and that's what happened. I found out about calorie counting which made my progress even better and taught me how to eat (I honestly had zero clue about the whole energy in vs energy out stuff). Then I found reddit and
r/fitness
and took in lots of info from here and just applied all the basics from the FAQ + other things, 2.5 years go by and boom! I'm fit enough to go to recruit training so I do, and I accomplish a huge goal!
Thats all I can think to write right now so feel free to ask questions!

fitness,https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/cg9c8d/the_absolute_beginners_guide_to_the_gym/,11096,408,The Absolute Beginner's Guide to the Gym,"Hello all,
​
First, this is not a post about exercise. This is a post about going to a gym!
I notice that every once in a while someone asks a question about gyms: joining them, using them, etiquette, etc. I also noticed that there isn't much about using or accessing gyms in the wiki, so hopefully this gets added (or not, if it's not useful). If you're new to getting in shape and want to use a gym for that, I hope this will answer any questions you may have.
This is based on my personal experience, and I'm sure many of you will have ""but my gym doesn't do it this way"" comments, so please feel free to comment and I'll adjust accordingly. Without further ado, let's talk about gyms!
​
What and why
A gym is a place that makes working out easier. It's usually a space dedicated to some form of physical activity that allows members to reach their fitness goals. Gyms vary quite drastically in what they offer, how they offer it, what they prioritize, etc. While you don't have to join a gym to get active or hit your fitness goals, it usually gives you access to equipment and resources you can't get otherwise (like weights, cardio equipment, pools, personal trainers, etc.). Unless you're hitting a specific exercise (running or swimming, for example), joining a gym is an easy way to get access to those resources.
Different gyms will prioritize different aspects of fitness and well-being. Most large gyms are all-rounders: they try to cater to weightlifters, bodybuilders, yoga enthusiasts, swimmers, runners, etc. Some gyms are more specialized: for example, some may have weights only. Or some might be single function (and probably not be called a gym at all): wall-climbing, yoga studios, Pilates studios, etc. What you join should depend on your goals, and this guide will cover as much as possible to help you decide and navigate the gyms.
​
What you would find at the gym
The reception
: almost without fail, there will be a desk at the front where someone will greet you and check that you're a member before letting you in. The people at the front desk are sometimes also trained as sales people, so they might try to sell you stuff, but once you're a member, they're there to help you out.
Free weights
: this will be one of the the most common items you'll find in gyms. The most basic weight option will probably be a
rack of dumbbells
, but you'll also see free weights,
Olympic barbells
, benches,
racks
, and all sorts of muscular
individuals
hauling these weights around. The variety and scale of equipment depends on the clientele, with some gyms having a much bigger area dedicated to weightlifting.
Resistance
machines
: these vary greatly in variety and function. Most will have some sort of weight selection, and they will mostly focus on one muscle or muscle group in the workout. While not very popular in
r/Fitness
, they do serve a function and are sometimes necessary (for example, they're good for back exercises). Some of them will have
cables
, some will have complex
levers
, and almost all will have a small
guide
on how to adjust the machine, how to use it, and which muscles it targets.
Cardio
equipment
: these are typically
treadmills
, elliptical machines, stationary bikes, rowing machines, and other devices that allow you to perform cardiovascular exercises without changing your location. They'll more often than not be seen in rows, usually opposite the windows or mirrors. As their name suggests, they help get your heart-rate up. They're probably the easiest to use, as you probably can run or cycle.
Body-weight and suspension area
: better equipped gyms might also have an area that seems somewhat emptier and allows for more freedom of movement, but might have a device like this
suspension rack
, and might have the big bouncy balls, or thick ropes attached to racks. These areas are designed for body-weight exercises, and will often attract personal trainers or even small group classes in ""
bootcamp
"" format.
Studios
: a
studio
is an area that is somewhat separated from the rest of the gym, usually by glass walls and doors, usually has mirrors on one side, and will sometimes have a stage. Studios are used for things like yoga classes, group exercise classes, etc. You might find yoga mats or exercise balls in there. Some are specialized: they might cycling studios or Pilates studios. Studios are usually open to members if there isn't an active class, and they're good for stretching or warming up/cooling down.
Specialized equipment
: some gyms have climbing walls, swimming pools, etc. It's worth asking about these if anything interests you.
Group exercise classes
: many gyms offer these classes (Les Mills, Spinning, yoga, Pilates, etc.). These are sometimes part of your membership, and are sometimes extra. You should check with your gym on if they have them and how you can sign up.
Gender-specific areas
: other than the obvious ones (showers and bathroom) some gyms might have female-only areas: could be a class, could be a studio, could be a certain time in the week. If you're female and would a ""safer"" environment, you can always ask about these
Showers & sauna
: most gyms will have lockers, changing rooms, showers, and some will have hair dryers, ironing boards, saunas, steam rooms, jacuzzis, etc. These are not important to everyone, but a shower might be worth confirming if you're planning on showering after a workout. Many gyms will also offer towels (a small one to carry around and a big one to dry yourself after showering).
Personal trainers
: as the name suggests, these individuals dedicate their time to just you in the gym! PT sessions are usually an hour to 90-minutes each, and are designed to help you focus and get better results. PTs are not for everyone. First, they're expensive. Second, they need you to agree on a predefined time and place to exercise. Third, you might not need them if you've been doing this for a while. However, they can be good if you're an absolute noob and prefer someone to handhold you for the first month or so. PT sessions are sold by the # of sessions, and can used over a specific period. Check with your gym on what options they may have.
Chillout area
: some of the nicer gyms will have a lounge area, with coffee, a juice bar, etc. available to the members. This isn't really related to exercise, but having an area like that makes a gym more appealing to some.
​
Cool, sound like fun! Where do I start?
First, find a convenient gym. I highly suggest a place that is either near work or near home; anything too far will lead to excuses for not going. You also need to make sure your gym has the equipment/timing/price that's good for you. Google is your friend (and I guess Yelp). Once you have one or two options, head down before the day you intend to start working out. Walk up to the reception and ask them for a tour of the facilities, and about their pricing options. I suggest you go the gym around the time you intend to work out, to see how busy it is. Don't forget to see the showers and lockers. Before signing up for a long-term contract, see if you can get a test run (some will give you a 3 day trial, some have one-month options). A one-month option helps you see if a gym is really for you (some people will always prefer to run/cycle/swim outdoors). If there are several gyms that are convenient location-wise, I suggest you see them all before signing any commitments.
A small note: while in general gyms and gym-goers are welcoming, some gym environments could be toxic (judgmental, show-offy, superficial). Don't be discouraged! That's why I suggest trying a gym out for a month, to make sure the environment is positive and supportive. You need to find a place that you'll be happy going to.
Second, once you've settled on the gym, get ready on the day you want to go. Wear some comfortable clothes and shoes, pack a change of clothes (if you need to change), a bottle of water, and head to the gym (I wouldn't initially worry about things like gloves or wraps; you won't need those for a while). At the reception, check in and ask for a towel (if the gym provides it), and ask for help for whatever you're trying to do: if it's weights, ask them for help with the weight area, cardio, ask for help with the machines, etc. The staff should be able to orient you and give you the basics of the gym. Ask about any special rules (use of chalk, grunting, music, etc., some have funny rules). At this point you should follow whatever program you've researched before. Remember, this is not a working out guide!
Third: shower and change, and congrats! day one is done! Keep in mind that a gym is not the cleanest of environments, so make sure you also wash your bottle, etc.
​
Gym etiquette
The most important thing you need to keep in mind is that no one in the gym cares about what you look like, how much you weight, and what exercises you perform.
Having said that, a gym is a common area, so it pays to be considerate. While exercising, observe the room. See how people wait for machines to be ready, how they behave, etc. Look for signs that talk about rules (for example, some gyms limit cardio machine usage ). If you're unsure about something, ask. Unless they're in the middle of their workout, most people are more than happy to help. The gym staff are there to help, so always feel free to ask them as well.
Weights
: if you're weightlifting, you're going to rest between sets. If the gym is busy, it is good form to share: other people can use the machines/devices/weights while you're resting between sets. Racks (squat, bench) get busy and sharing helps everyone move more quickly. Quick note: if you're sharing equipment/machines, and you're listening to music, male sure you take your headphones/earphones off so you can communicate. You need to hear your buddy. This is especially important if you're ever spotting someone.
If you're using a bench or a seat, it's good form to place a towel where you might sweat on it, and wipe it down after you're done. Before grabbing weights from a machine/bar, check to see if someone is still using them (asking won't harm). Always return your weights to the weight rack. Don't be the disruptive asshole (grunting loudly, dropping weights). If you're unsure about something, or need help with an exercise, ask other people who are not actually working out. The big buff guys are probably the nicest as they usually remember what it was like being a beginner.
Some seasoned lifters in here pointed out that dropping weights and grunting are part of the workout. That's very true, but doesn't mean you get to be an asshole about it. Is there rubber on the floor? Is there a deadlift area? Are you grunting in effort or to show off? Again, it's really about being considerate.
Cardio
: observe the time limit if there are people waiting, and wipe your sweat off when you're done.
Studio use
: return everything you use in there. Turn off the lights if necessary. Don't drop weights on the wooden floor.
Body weight area
: make sure there isn't a class or someone else using the equipment. If it's an individual, ask if sharing is ok. If it's a class, either join in/sign up, or wait for it to finish.
Group classes
: these usually need you sign up early, and your membership needs to include them. Always put your equipment away after the class is done, or wipe your sweat puddle. Think of people using the gym after you.",

(Female @140lb bodyweight)","Yesterday I hit a 455lb / 207kg deadlift, which brought my total up to 1,002lb. I am super psyched! When I started out I couldn't even imagine this was even possible. Bodyweight between 137 and 140lb (~63kg).
Videos of lifts
Squat 347lb / 157.5kg + stiff bar comp deadlift of 435lb / 197.5kg
Bench 200lb / 90.7kg
Deadlift 455lb / 207kg on deadlift bar
Past Training
I've been lifting off and on since the summer of 2011, so about 6.5 years. I started powerlifting training specifically in the fall of 2013, my 1st powerlifting meet was summer 2014 after reddit told me I was actually pretty good and should compete, lol. I was 110lb / 50kg when I started lifting.
I was self coached up until this past summer when I started working with RTS and Mike.
I did starting strength my 1st year of powerlifting but stalled out around the time I did my 1st meet. My numbers were S:245 B:135 D:335 @120lb bodyweight. After that, I switched to a PPL x2 that I wrote. I did that for another year and a half till my lifts were around S: 275 B:150 D:405. I then started an upper/lower split where I did bench 2x a week and squat + deadlifts 2x a week but I alternated which I focused on as the main lift. I was on that until I started coaching with RTS. My lifts were S:315 B:175 D:425 and bodyweight was 128 out of comp.
Current Training
I decided to go up a weight class at that time, from 125 (57kg) to 138 (63kg). I am 5'5 so I was doing myself a huge disservice competing in the 57kg class where everyone else was a half foot smaller than me. Since going up 4 months ago, my lifts have increased dramatically and so has my wilks! RTS had me on an upper/lower split similar to my old one till I competed at USAPL Raw Nationals last month.
Since Nationals, I have been on a full body routine 4x a week, with a bench variation each workout as well as a squat or deadlift variation and accessories. The volume each workout is low to make up for the high frequency. It took my joints and muscles about 3 weeks to get used to the frequency. I seem to be handling it ok now.
The deadlift PR was a total YOLO move on my part and not programmed at all :). I wanted to play with the deadlift bar. This was my 2nd time ever using one, with the 1st being back in 2014.

Diet
Pretty relaxed. I suck at eating so my #1 goal is just getting my calories. I maintain around 2200-2500. My #2 goal is getting enough protein. I aim for 100g bare minimum and 160g+ when I am prepping for a comp. For supplements, I use protein powder and sometimes take creatine. I take a multivitamin, fish oil, vitamin D, zinc, magnesium, and melatonin every night before bed.",

https://imgur.com/a/xw1rqB8
I occasionally post progress pictures on IG if you'd like to follow me - @austin.sure
Started at 275lbs and now down to 170!
Here's the breakdown of how this actually went down. To begin, this picture is from when I had already lost 50 pounds (so around 210-220).
The first 50 pounds was lost 100% through using a keto diet paired with strict calorie counting. I kept my daily calorie intake around 1400-1600 per day and it took approximately 4 months to shed the first 50 pounds. Again, no exercise was used, barely even walks around the neighborhood.
The next 50-60 pounds, I decided I'd like to speed things up a bit so I implemented running around my neighborhood paired with some light dumbbell training. Mainly just 15 pound dumbbells and different variations of chest presses, curls, tricep extensions, etc. This got me all the way down to 160 pounds. Now was the time to actually build up muscle and by this point I was 3 years into the process.
So for the last 5 years I've kept the same workouts and have progress. I have been running PHAT (Power Hypertrophy Adaptive Training). It's a 5 day a week workout program that I stuck to religiously and over the past 5 years I can count on both my hands the amount of workouts I actually missed.
Instead of typing out the workout, I used this spreadsheet here:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z88d0BCV7jDOyPouLc5TzYjAqY9u_p8ZnTmDkaABACE/edit#gid=0
I have gone through 5 years of bulking and cutting cycles and have finally reached the body I want.
If anyone has any questions about any of my struggles along the way, please reach out and I'll try my hardest to help!
As for diet, it was strictly an IIFYM approach. I did this 100% through calorie counting!!! No BS fad diets or anything. I ate what I wanted, when I wanted, but as long as I was under my caloric goals for the day (around 1600-1800 for cutting, 2800-3000 for bulking) I always saw results.

Before and After Photos
(TLDR):
Weight:
215lbs —> 155 lbs
(That’s 97.5kg down to 70.3kg)
Time Period:
Technically 3 years of weight loss (explained in post) but the most dramatic changes happened in the past year. I started lifting in May of 2017.
Lift Progress Summary:
DL:       95lbs -–> 295x3 (275x5)
Squat:  75lbs —> 265x5
Bench: 105lbs –> 185x3 (175x5)
OHP:    65lbs —> 115x5
Never did 1-rep Maxes. These are just the highest lifts I’ve recorded in the gym.
Most of these are from a few months ago when I weighed a few more pounds and my lifting routine was more ‘consistent.’ My lifts are a bit lower now.
Program:
For the most part, I based it on
u/metallicadpa
’s PPL Program. It’s available in the ‘recommended routines’ in this subreddit’s wiki.
EDIT: A lot of folks in the comments asked for a link to the PPL program. Here it is:
https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/
Disclaimer: I didn’t truly follow this program as prescribed. And to be honest, if I had stuck to this program more strictly, I’m sure I would’ve seen a lot better results. It’s very effective. But for a variety of life/personal reasons combined with some fuckarounditis, it wouldn’t be fair to the creator to say that I ‘actually’ followed his program for a full year. Nonetheless, I’m pretty happy with my progress so far and I owe a lot to this program for giving me my foundation.
Diet
As for Diet, I just tracked my calories with MyFitnessPal.
The specifics of what I ate are not too important - but the act of counting calories consistently is the single most important thing I did in this entire journey.
Yes daily calorie-tracking is tedious. Yes it sucks. But that’s exactly why so many people fail at weight loss. If you want the results bad enough, you’ll do it.
Anyway - A typical day of eating might look like this:
-I skip breakfast most days. I guess this means I “intermittent fast.” It works for me because I’m not hungry in the morning and I’m always very hungry after work / in the evening.
Lunch (~420 calories)
Turkey sandwich on thin wheat
*
Sliced orange/yellow bell peppers
Dannon Light/Fit Greek Yogurt
I like to meal prep this on Sundays so it’s basically on auto-pilot.
Dinner: (1000-1100 calories)
Chicken Breast - 8-12oz
Small/healthy microwaveable meals, usually with Chicken (think weight watchers, healthy choice, etc)
Steamed Vegetables
A few cups of Greek Yogurt
Also coffee and water. Copious amounts of black coffee and water.
PREFACE:
First, this is probably not the most dramatic transformation you’ll ever read. But this roughly marks 1 year of ‘getting my shit’ together so it seems like a fitting time for a progress post. So much has changed for me in the last year, between work, life, fitness, and more - and most of it started with discovering the
r/fitness
community a year ago. So it felt like the right time to post something.
Second, while this post is not about video games - some sections will talk about them in-detail. I’ll try to mark the sections as skippable for the non-gaming audience here. But I think there are a lot of folks, specifically gamers, who might be in a similar situation to the ‘old’ me. So I’m leaving those details in this story for folks who might be in a similar phase of their fitness journey to where I used to be.
Lastly, I’ll note that I don’t believe video games are inherently ‘bad’ (I still enjoy them a lot from time to time). It’s just that in my case, my old approach to games reinforced a very problematic and sedentary lifestyle. A lifestyle that I’m now happy to be rid of.
Alright, let’s begin -
Background / How I got fat
I’ve actually been out of shape for most of my life.  I almost never exercised or thought at all about the consequences of what I was eating. I typically ate whatever was either convenient or tasted good without ever thinking about what I was putting into my body.
Growing up, I never had any athletic sports that I was passionate about, but I definitely did have a ‘competitive drive.’ My main hobby growing up was playing video games - a hobby that i’ve loved since as long as I could remember holding a SNES controller in my hands. As I got older, this ‘drive’ manifested itself in my gaming experience. Starting with Halo, then Starcraft 2 (hey look at my reddit name), then eventually League of Legends and more - the drive kept me hooked on games. I was determined to get better.
The positive side - is that I developed some helpful habits that helped me to get decently good at games. I had the discipline to constantly self-criticize my own play, refine my technique, and learn from gaming professionals in order to get better than my peers and improve.
But this ‘drive’ mindset was a double-edged sword. While the ‘focus’ was certainly valuable, I realize now that I was actually extremely narrow-minded. I ignored many other critical aspects of my life in favor of competitive improvement. It took me a long time to realize this. Snapping out of it - really all began here with
r/fitness
.
College - The Weight-Gain Train
When I went to college, everything got worse...waaaaaaay worse. My newfound ‘freedom’ led to increased consumption of junk food, much more heavy drinking. I basically realized I could eat Pizza and Chipotle whenever I wanted. So I did just that.
I was also a chronic procrastinator and had a very unhealthy approach to academics. It would not be uncommon to find me in a computer lab procrastinating until 2:30am, ordering a pizza, and then finally doing my assignment. Despite spending hours constantly procrastinating or gaming, I always told myself “I didn’t have the time to workout” because I was constantly behind on schoolwork.
This led to a significant weight gain (I know, shocker!). But I got better at games - which was all I really cared about.
Post-Graduation
When I graduated I weighed about 215lbs. I gained more than 40 pounds while in my 4 years at school.
Now that I had graduated and had a full-time job, I ‘said’ enough is enough and tried to refine some of my bad habits. I cut out major diet offenders. No more late night pizza orders. No more soda or energy drinks. Yes I’d still frequently eat junk food for dinner and didn’t track my calories, but I forced myself to at least eat a healthier lunch.
And I began running. God this sucked at first. I remember I couldn’t run a single damn mile. Not even close. I was wheezing and drooping in sweat in less than a half-mile. But I just kept going to a local park after work and made running part of my routine.  Gradually the distance increased substantially.
All these new habits took me a long way. I lost quite a bit of weight (at least 20lbs). I was feeling good about it. Eventually even tried on my old suit and my crazy long sleeves made me feel like one of those inflatable ‘arm flailing’ tube men that you see in front of grand openings. Success (or so I thought).
But eventually the progress stopped. The weight loss halted. It happened because it got harder and I wasn’t actually pushing myself. I wasn’t really trying.
And I also still poured almost every free moment I had into video games...
From Gaming to Fitness
This section probably won’t make any sense to anyone who doesn’t play competitive video games so you can SKIP this section and jump to ‘EPIPHANY’ if that’s not your cup-of-tea.
But failing to get promoted into Diamond league in League of Legends might’ve been one the best things that ever happened to me. Let me attempt to explain.
I was not just a casual gamer. I always strived to be competitive. I always wanted to be the best (or at least constantly getting better). I was addicted to seeing myself improve. In order to make that happen, I developed a sense of discipline and practice that helped me to climb decently fast. I won’t pretend I was a League ‘God’ or anything. There are many better players than me. But I eventually climbed to top 2% in North America. I also co-launched and hosted a weekly podcast related to teaching people how to improve at the game (shoutout to anyone from Tforce/4wards who might be reading this) and I gave individual coaching/lessons. And that was all while working a full-time job with a 1.5hour commute, often playing half as many ranked games as many of my similarly-ranked peers.
Now I attribute my rapid climb to my discipline & focus combined with my ‘drive.’ No matter how high I climbed, I was a constant student of the game. I learned from watching Korean pro players who were way better than me. I’d spend hours breaking down what they did to be successful and trying to apply it to my own play. I constantly ‘drilled’ myself in somewhat repetitive tasks and game mechanics until it was almost sub-conscious to me. I regularly reviewed my play, or when I’d make mistakes and was very critical of myself because I wanted to get better.
And I climbed because…I wanted it. I wanted it bad. I worked really hard at it. I was driven. But as anyone who has played the game knows - many folks don’t truly care about their rank until the season is about to end. Until there’s a deadline that they have to address. That was me (remember I mentioned I was a procrastinator?).
At the very end of season 6 of league of legends, I decided to “push myself” to get into Diamond - but I had waited way too long to start. As the deadline approached, I dropped nearly everything else in my life to focus on climbing. I basically sat at my computer all day grinding games, practicing technique, or reviewing replays. Eat, sleep, game, repeat. I put in a ton of work and saw a tremendous amount of progress in a short period of time…
But...it didn’t happen. I ran out of time. The weekend before the season ended, I was a single victory away from winning a promotion series that would have granted me my coveted “diamond border” multiple times. But I didn’t make it. I was crushed.
Why do I mention this all this gaming nonsense? I swear it connects back to fitness. Here we go.
When I didn’t make it to Diamond, my first instinct was to get the climb out of the way early in Season 7. I was already practically there - so I thought “this will be a piece of cake.” With this mindset I became lazy. I cut a lot of corners that helped me to climb in the first place and eventually started falling in rank. I realized that if I wanted to see the type of progress I needed to climb quickly again - I was going to have to invest every ounce of my free time and energy into this game again…
…And then that thought filled me with dread.
EPIPHANY
Wait. why? Why should I work so hard for this?
Now knowing how grueling my experience would be to get back to another Diamond promotion series with my old approach to the game - I asked myself - how could I possibly justify it? I would have to give up every free moment of my life to get a shiny border on a loading screen for internet bragging rights.
I decided that I’d be better off putting my time and efforts into something else. I hypothesized that if I put half as much effort into any other aspect of my life as I did trying to climb in video games - that I could see tremendous results. So I decided to test that theory…with fitness.
I then quit playing ranked league altogether, took a “before” photo - and then read the
r/fitness
wiki.
Foray into fitness - 1 Year Ago
Many initial struggles. I was terrified of attempting compound lifting movements at they gym. But I also knew they were important. I watched a bunch of YouTube videos on proper form and read a bunch of articles on diet. Most importantly - I read through the
r/fitness
wiki. Multiple times.
I settled on doing
u/metallicadpa
’s PPL routine. And I started counting my calories strictly.
A month later - wow.
2 months and some beginner gains later -
Holy shit.
This actually works.
I realized that if you truly work at something with persistence and  discipline day-in and day-out - then the seemingly impossible suddenly becomes possible. And I was never the same again.
Transforming my Life
With all this extra time I had saved from not grinding video games - it quickly became apparent that I should pick up some new hobbies and practices.
I picked up rock climbing to stay active. I got back into playing guitar -which I hadn’t played in years. I pushed myself to be more social and outgoing after years of sitting inside a room playing games until 2am  nearly every evening. Soon my whole life felt very different.
Over the course of the next year:
WORK - I got promoted, and also joined an awesome new team recently. They’re the best.
SOCIAL - I made new friends, re-kindled old friendships, and ‘hung out’ with people way more than when I was grinding games. I shifted from my narrow-minded self that was only concerned with video games, who struggled to relate to people —> to being genuinely interested in other people and their passions. It’s been a massive life-changer.
LIVING - I gradually transitioned from a recent college grad with student-loan debt living with his parents to an adult who is living debt-free in one of the most incredible cities in the world.
PRODUCTIVITY, PROCRASTINATION, & STRESS - I realized that a lot of the stress I had and procrastination could be avoided by applying proper discipline and planning. By writing things down and properly managing my time with discipline day-in and day-out, I often work half as hard as I used to and achieve 5-10x times the results in terms of productivity. I often think back on how much stress I had during school with procrastination, and I now think I could easily get way better grades with half the amount of ‘effort.’
TRAVEL - Last year I went on a two-week Euro-trip with my friends and it was one of the best experiences of my life. This
photo from Norway
has one of my best genuine smiles. I love doing active & outdoor activities now. I am planning to travel more in the coming months.
A brief note regarding fitness, girls, and confidence:
A lot of people get into fitness to attract the opposite sex (or same sex). It was certainly a ‘motivating factor’ for me initially.
And yes - the gains have helped :)
But really, the added confidence I gained from smiling at myself in the mirror in the morning, combined with developing a more broad range of hobbies & interests - did way more for my dating life than just fitness alone. If I just replaced my obsession with gaming with an obsession with fitness - I doubt I would be as happy as I am now.
Looking forward
I’ve never really “bulked” before. I’m eager to see where I could be after a full bulk-cut cycle. But right now, fitness has taken a bit of a back-seat compared to some other priorities in my life. That said, I’m looking to start my first true ‘bulk’ sometime in the late fall, most likely November.
For now, I’ll continue my weekly ritual of eating at a deficit during the week so that I can enjoy the weekends without as much guilt and still say ‘somewhat’ lean. I’m probably not going to have a 6 pack at this rate (not willing to give up alcohol and other delicious weekend foods right now). Admittedly, that was a pretty hard pill to swallow initially but I’ve come to terms with it. That said, I lead a pretty active lifestyle and I don’t anticipate I’ll get too out of shape either. And then I’ll reign it all in and get ‘strict’ again once I start my bulk so it doesn’t get too out of control.
Tips / advice that helped me
-
Read the wiki.
I know that this is beaten to death here, but seriously do it. It’s probably the most important thing related to fitness that I’ve ever read.
-Consistency is everything. Fuck “motivation.” This is about consistently about getting your ass in the gym and watching your diet. Even on days when you really don’t want to.
-Once you lose some weight - remember to buy new clothes that fit you. Seriously makes a big difference.
-Meal prep on Sundays. Eat copious amounts of Chicken & Greek Yogurt. Drink plenty of Black Coffee.
Special Thanks
-This community. Especially progress posters. You gave me the reinforcement I needed. Thank you.
-Thanks to
u/metallicadpa
for writing the PPL program.
-And special thanks to the mods who keep this place up and running
Lastly I’ll just say this:
If you decide you want it bad enough, that’s literally all it takes. Fitness is not complicated.
There’s no magical barrier from preventing you from succeeding. Ignore any dumb voice or excuse in your head. It’s all bullshit.
Seriously, your results are yours, and they are there for the taking. Just start.",

I show the proper positioning for many joints and how to use incline push ups to build your strength up in case you don't have the strength to do them properly on the floor.
Edit/Update:
So like, this thing kinda blew up... Who knew push ups were so popular? I want to take this opportunity to say that if you are interested in more bodyweight exercises, I am the shirtless mod over at

and we have a full-body routine complete with warm up and progressions for anybody of any level:
The routine is hosted on

www.fitloop.co
, and there's even an
Android app
of the routine on google play. (And guess what, they're both open source, too!)

Male / 5'6"" / 43 yrs
Started @ 155lbs
Current @ 134
90 Day Transformation - BEFORE AND AFTER PHOTOS
DIET
I started by cutting out sugar and sodas.
I substitute sugar with stevia.
I stated my macros with a 40/35/25 split of carbs/protein/fat.
I choose this macro to ensure I was consuming enough protein in order to minimize muscle loss.
I made sure to eat approx 0.85 to 1 gram of protein per 1lb of lean muscle mass in order to minimize muscle loss while dropping weight.
When I first started getting serious, I was 155 @ 24% Body Fat. That means I had 118 lbs of lean body muscle (LBM) and 37lbs of fat.
Therefore, I would consume 120 grams of protein which is approx 480 calories. The rest of my calories would go into carbs and fat.
I'm a very busy parent and making sure I was consuming enough protein was a challenge. So to help out I would drink approx 2 protein shakes daily, one for breakfast and another with dinner. I usually added bananas or other fruits.
Sometimes I use peanut butter powder. I hate water in my shakes and found using Silk Almond Milk sugar free only had 30 calories per 8 oz. Worked great as a milk substitute.
Lunch usually consisted of oatmeal with cinammon and stevia with some Silk Almond Milk. These were my main carbs for the day.
Dinner included a lot of kale salads with veggies. I often added tomatoes, cucumbers, sliced carrots, radishes, etc..
Sometimes I'd add tuna or chicken breast if I needed to mix it up or hit my protein target. Salad dressings were mostly fat free or low calorie (approx 30-60 calories per 2 tablespoons).
Sides included microwaved baby red potatoes with some country crock, salt and pepper. These were great as I found my hunger would subside by eating potatoes and noticed the calorie to gram weight was a good balance compared to other types of carbs like chips, pretzels, popcorn or other snacks.
Snacks included nuts, plantain chips, orveille redenbacher smart pop popcorn, celery or an apple.
CALORIES
I made sure to calculate my daily Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) without workouts.
I then multiplied my TDEE by 7 to get my weekly calories so I knew how much I could consume for the week. I added 3500 to that number to get my maintenance calories. Subtracted 7000 calories so I could lose approx 2lbs per week and divided by 7 to get my daily calories.
So, at 155 lbs my TDEE was 1875. Weekly that was 13,125 calories. My total weekly workouts added another 4000-5000 calories for a total of 17,125 to 18,125 calories. From there I would subtract 7,000 calories to get a 2lb weekly weight loss. This meant I could only consume 11,125 weekly or approx 1,600 calories daily. However, it was important that I hit that 4000-5000 calorie weekly workout.
EXCERCISE
Starting around January 2019, I was almost 170 lbs, barely able to wear size 33 pants and really out of shape.
I started eating healthier by eating oatmeal, veggies, salads and less fast food. By April 2019, I dropped down to 160.
I started counting my steps with a tracker and targeted 10K steps per day. By June 2019 I was down to 155 where I plateaued for 6 weeks. That's when I got fed up at not making any more progress. Here's what happened next.
TOOLS
Garmin Vivoactive Smartwatch
Jump rope
Wahoo Heart Rate Monitor (HRM)
Food Scale
Weight Scale that calculates Fat Percentage
Tape measure
The smartwatch helps me track my daily steps and connects to the Wahoo HRM when I do activities where I don't want to risk damaging my phone (swimming, mud races, etc..)
Jump rope is probably the best tool in my arsenal. It's cheap and highly effective in burning calories efficiently.
Food scale is a must. I needed to know how much I was consuming so I could target how many calories I could eat on a weekly basis.
The weight scale with fat percentage calculation helped show that I was dropping fat % and not just weight.
Tape measure to help calculate body fat using online calculators.
SOFTWARE
MyFitnessPal calorie counter
Garmin Connect activity tracker
Polars Polarbeat activity tracker
SyncMytracks Pro (Android)
Strong (Android)
MyFitnessPal is AMAZING! I have it connected to my Garmin Connect Account where my workouts and steps are imported. From there I can see how I'm progressing. I can track my weight and upload photos as motivation. Seeing the progress via photos and graphs REALLY MOTIVATED me.
I also use Polars Polarbeat activity tracker for my workouts, primarily because I do heart rate training workouts. From there, SyncMytracks exports my workouts and imports them into Garmin Connect which uploads them to MyFitnessPal.
WORKOUTS
Ok, so I've learned A LOT over the last 3 months.
The BIGGEST TAKEAWAY is this... long periods of high intensity cardio is NOT the best for ""cutting"".
I learned that short HIIT sessions are MUCH more efficient and effective.
Here's my routines:
Morning workouts consist of 45 minutes of low intensity cardio. This included riding a bike and jump rope.
I would ride my bike and try to keep my heart rate around 115-135 BPM.For me that was approx 65-75% of my MAX HR. In this range, approx 25% of the calories I use/burn in my workout comes from fat which was my main target, not muscle growth.
After about 45 minutes, I would transition to a 10 minute HIIT routine where my heart rate is at 90% or more of my Max HR.
Afternoon workout consisted of strength training. This is where I would weight lift, low weights high reps and high sets for about 45 minutes.
I used the Strong Android app to track my workouts and see my progress.
I followed
this article
as my workout routine for weight-lifting/strength training routines. Very simple to follow.
That's pretty much it.
As of now, my goal is to hit 130 lbs @ 10% body fat then start a clean bulk program to build muscle mass. I have approx 2 weeks to go.
Hope this helps and if anyone has more questions feel free to ask.
EDIT:
WOW!!!! I did not expect this to blow up. Thank you kind strangers for my first gold and silver.
There are a lot of questions about diet, workouts, tools, etc....
I'll update with more details tonight. I've been answering by mobile so it's taking a long time to type this out. When I get home I'll update with more info soon as I get home.",
fitness,https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5pwxki/foam_rollers_and_lacrosse_balls_are_awesome/,8641,509,Foam rollers and lacrosse balls are awesome self-massage tools that can be used to practically relax your entire body. I love them so much I have made videos showing how I use them (and GIFs of them to save you time!),"What is a foam roller? How does it work?
A foam roller is a large, cylindrical self massage tool. You roll over this cylinder and the pressure of your own bodyweight helps to knead your muscles and relax large areas of your body. So, that's why I have one. It's like getting free massages for the rest of your life.
Link to video tutorial on how to use the foam roller.
Foam Rolling GIFs
I also made looping GIF's with my doggie to help save you time.
Upper Back
(avoid lower back; edit:
read here why
)
Neck
(not meant to be aggressive)
Calves
Shins
(lateral side to get anterior tibialis)
Quads / Hip Flexors
(bent legs and/or straight legs)
IT Band / VLO / Hip
Note:
I like to do 10 passes for each body part. However, you don't
have to
constantly roll back and forth. Sometimes, just putting pressure on ONE tender spot and holding it for 30-60sec is effective, too.
What is a lacrosse ball? How does it work?
When someone gives you a deep tissue massage, they use their palms/fingers/elbows to apply pressure to help relax tight muscles and make you feel better. A lacrosse ball is a fairly hard, dense ball about the size of a tennis ball that helps mimic this deep release massage with your own bodyweight. It allows for much more localized pressure than a foam roller.
Link to video tutorial on how to use a lacrosse ball.
The best part is that you could go to town on your
glutes and hamstrings
in a way that not even many massage-therapists will because of how intimate that area is. (When was the last time someone FIRMLY massaged your ASS? Right?)  So thats why I have one, to get free ass massages, haha. (No but seriously, it's great for the whole body.)
Lacrosse Ball GIFs
Again, I made GIF's with my doggie to help save time.
Gluteus Maximus
Piriformis
Hamstrings
(sit on hard surface and place under thigh)
Feet / Plantar Fascia
(hold onto something for balance)
Upper Back (Traps)
Triceps/Brachialis
Triceps alternative style
(tack ball and straighten/bend elbow)
Gluteus Medius
(Static, just chill over it)
Deltoids & Upper Chest against wall (no GIF of this, it's in the video tho and it's worth mentioning that you could do it)
Note: Instead of constantly just rolling over the parts in question, you could also statically hold against them and just breath and relax for 30-60seconds. This works extremely well for the glutes and triceps and many other areas.
Lacrosse Ball Alternatives
If you don't have a lacrosse ball, you could use a tennis ball, baseball, softball, billiard ball, cricket ball, floor hockey ball, golf ball, spalding bouncey ball as alternatives. They don't work as well as the lacrosse one in some cases, but it's better than nothing and sometimes it may even be better!
With the combination of a lacrosse ball and foam roller, I can practically massage most of my body and the best part is,
these don't take up much room and I could easily travel with them,
especially
the lacrosse ball. Happy rolling!

fitness,https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4aozzf/i_recently_finished_eating_and_training_like/,8191,269,"I recently finished eating and training like Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson for 33 days. (37/M/6’3”/208lbs). Results, Pics, Thoughts, and The Rock’s Response.","Starting February 1, I began my “Rock’ing for 30 Days” challenge to eat and train like Dwayne Johnson for 30 days. As it ended on a Tuesday, I finished out the week, completing a total of 33 days of the challenge.
Three weeks ago,
I shared all the details about the eating and workout plan
, so I won’t repeat it here.
TL;DR SUMMARY
After eating 5300 calories a day for 33 days, more than 23 hours of cardio, and almost 80lbs of cod!, I gained a total of 1lb. After over 28 hours of weight training, I got leaner and gained some muscle in my upper arms (most triceps), upper legs (mostly quads), my upper chest (you can see it pulled my chest up). Here are the
before and after photos
.
THE ROCK’S RESPONSES
I blogged every day during this month and a few articles got written about the challenge. They came to the attention of The Rock, who had a few things to say on Twitter about it. He doubted me at first, but then came around.
Here are screengrabs of The Rock’s tweets
.
LIFTING RESULTS
I got stronger, though I hadn’t done much isolated lifting in years, so definitely a lot of beginner gains here. I probably increased weights around 10-15% or so. Just to pick two random exercises for an example:  In the beginning of the month, I started the incline bench at around 115lbs (4x12/10/8/6), and now it starts at 150lbs. I was originally doing the 200 reps of leg press at 160-180lbs, now it’s at 220-240lbs.
One change to the workout: in week 3, the lack of ab work became quite apparent, so I added 3 ab exercises: leg raises, russian twist, and stir the pot. More details are shown in the Google doc below.
SO NO WEIGHT GAIN?
Apparently not. I didn’t skip a single meal, ate every bite, and had nothing else besides this food the entire time. I thought I would put on a few pounds, so getting leaner was a surprise. I had never really subscribed to a pure “calories in, calories out” belief, and this experience killed it for me. It’s more than how much you eat, what you eat makes a huge difference.
Here’s a photo gallery showing meal prep

Terrific. Even with so much food, I never felt overly full. Every morning I would do 50 mins of cardio, then eat 10oz of cod, 2 cups of oatmeal, and 2 hard boiled eggs (at the gym!) then weight train. I always used to work out on a mostly empty stomach (just a shake) so I thought this would make me nauseous, but it felt good.
Even with all the workouts, I never felt sore. All the food seemed to be fueling my recovery. Even the little aches and pains of being in your late 30’s went away. I also was serious about stretching/foam-rolling at the end of the workouts, so I didn’t feel very tight either.
WAS IT WORTH IT?
I decided to do this as a challenge to myself, to see if I had to discipline to wake up at 5am everyday, do all these workouts, prepare all this food in advance, eat every meal, have no cheating, and live my normal life. I have no aspirations to get huge like The Rock, and 30 days wouldn’t do it anyway. Overall, it was an extremely positive experience, and I highly encourage everyone to push themselves to try something new for a month.
If I had to do it over, the only change would be to take a ton of measurements, pictures, body scans, blood tests, etc beforehand. Would have been nice to quantify it more. There seems to have been a nice change in my body fat %, would have been great to have those numbers (anyone want to make estimates?).
Would I suggest this plan to others? If you’re chasing the physical results, you’re almost certainly better off putting together a routine and meal plan specifically for you. It’s also extremely expensive, at $42/day. While cod is an excellent source of low calorie, low fat protein, that benefit doesn’t outweigh the cost of, say, chicken breast.
WHAT IS WORTH INCORPORATING?
You could probably eat more, as long as it’s the right foods. Experiment with increasing your protein and overall calories with good, clean food, and see what happens.
This is personal preference, but I liked doing cardio first, then weights, which I had never done. It’s a good warmup, and it’s nice to be done for the day after you lift that last weight.
Mastering efficient food prep is key. Not having to decide what you’re eating at every meal is a pleasure, and not having to cook it. And with practice, you get a ton of return on your time investment. I can make 18 meals in about an hour now. I’ll keep prepping food every few days.
I have eaten mostly keto for years, but man, oatmeal is delicious. Starting every day with it moving forward.
WHAT’S NEXT
I want to follow a more sustainable version of this program for longer, starting with another 30 days. So far, I’m doing the same workouts 5x a week. I changed up the diet to have 5 meals, no cod, and comes in at 3579cal/451C/59F/294P. So far, I have noticed I’m getting a bit sore now, in a way I wasn’t before, so I’m going to keep experimenting here to come up with a better version. 
If there is interest in me sharing that diet, or putting up an update post after following a tweaked plan for 30 days, let me know. Or if anyone wants more detail on any specific piece of this, let me know.

As usual, don’t bother with media headlines -- this study is NOT a blow to low-carb dieting, which can be quite effective due to factors such as typically higher protein and more limited junk food options. Rather, this study shows that a low-carb diet isn’t necessary for fat loss and that lowering carbs and insulin doesn’t provide a magical metabolic advantage. 
 It bears repeating: if you even try to apply this study to the real world of dieting choices, you will be frowned upon strongly. Even the lead author writes:
If you need a broad and simple takeaway from this study, here is one: weight loss does not rely on certain carb levels or manipulation of insulin, it relies on eating less. Don’t be scared that eating carbs will cause insulin to trap fat inside your fat cells.",

Since a young boy, I have always struggled with being overweight and have had countless failed attempts trying to lose it. On April 3rd of last year, I decided to finally commit and really push myself to the limit and beyond both physically and mentally. I knew this time was different; my mindset and determination to succeed were stronger than ever before. Over this past year, I have learned so much, about weight loss, exercise, dieting, and myself as a person. With the use of IF/OMAD (Intermittent Fasting/One Meal A Day), keeping CICO in mind, and a consistent workout routine, I have been able to lose 180+ pounds thus far.
Height: 6’2
Age: 20 years old
Weight Difference in Before and After Picture: 438 lbs to 260 lbs (178 lbs lost)
Exercise:
I have been doing a bodybuilding routine in order to try to maintain and build as much muscle as possible while I am simultaneously losing all the weight I am. So doing a muscle building workout routine has definitely been key for me to help with my physique and not have me looking flat with all the weight I am losing.  Also, I workout (both lifting and cardio) in a fasted state, mainly to help burn fat and build muscle more efficiently.
Since I started working out in April of last year, I have tried out a variety of routines (Bro Split, 4-Day UL, 6-Day UL, 6-Day PPL, 5-Day ULPPL) and have had success with all of them but find the best and most efficient for my current schedule to be the 5-Day Upper, Lower, Push, Pull, Legs routine. I do this routine while incorporating cardio (usually HIIT) right after I am done lifting on at least 3 of those days typically. I also try to stay active on any rest days and get cardio in through sports like basketball, soccer, boxing, or going for a jog whenever I can.
Here is the current routine I am following:
Day 1 (Upper Day):
Bench Press - 4 sets - 5-8 reps
Barbell Row - 4 sets - 5-8 reps
DB Overhead Press - 3 sets - 5-8 reps
Wide-grip Pulldowns or Pull-ups - 3 sets - 6-10 reps
DB curls - 4 sets - 8-12 reps
Straight-arm Pulldowns/Face-pulls - 3 supersets - 8-12 reps
Day 2 (Lower Day):
Back Squat - 4 sets - 5-8 reps
Deadlift - 3 sets - 5-8 reps
Hack Squat - 3 sets - 5-8 reps
Lying Leg Curls - 3 sets - 8-12 reps
Single-leg Leg Press - 3 sets - 8-12 reps
Standing Calf-Raises - 4 sets - 10-15 reps
Core Workout - 4 sets - 10-15 reps
Day 3: REST / Do some form of cardio (Play sports, go for a jog, etc.)
Day 4 (Pull Day):
Barbell Row - 4 sets - 6-10 reps
Wide-grip Pulldowns or Pullups - 3 sets - 6-10 reps
T-bar, Cable or DB Rows - 3 sets - 6-10 reps
Close-grip Pulldowns - 3 sets - 8-12 reps
Straight-arm Pulldowns/Facepulls - 3 supersets - 10-15 reps each
Barbell Curls - 3 sets - 8-12 reps
Hammer Curls, Cable or DB - 3 sets - 8-12 reps
Day 5 (Push Day):
DB Bench Press - 4 sets - 6-10 reps
Overhead Press - 3 sets - 6-10 reps
Incline DB Press - 3 sets - 6-10 reps
Cable Crossovers (standing or seated) - 3 sets - 8-12 reps
Lateral Raises - 3 sets - 8-12 reps
Close-grip Bench Press - 3 sets - 8-12 reps
Tricep Extensions - 3 sets - 8-12 reps
Day 6 (Leg Day):
Back Squat - 4 sets - 6-10 reps
Deadlift - 3 sets - 6-10 reps
Leg Press - 3 sets - 6-10 reps
Leg Extensions/Leg Curls - 3 supersets - 8-12 reps
Seated Calf-Raises - 4 sets - 10-15 reps
Core Workout - 4 sets - 10-15 reps
Day 7: REST / Do some form of cardio (Play sports, Go for a jog, etc.)
Diet:
I believe that finding a long-term sustainable diet really is essential not only for losing weight, but ensuring you keep the weight off! Finding the right plan is a person to person basis so I did a lot of experimenting with different dieting techniques (IF, OMAD, Keto, Atkins etc.) until I was able to find one that I was pleased by and could see myself doing long-term. Currently, I am doing OMAD/IF on a High Protein, Low Carb diet.
Macros:
Currently I try to keep it roughly 40-45% protein, 30-35% fats, and 20% carbs. I am not very strict on these percentages but aim to keep within these ranges as much as possible.
Day of eating:
Most days I am doing OMAD (One Meal A Day) and I have this meal usually right after I workout (workout is done fasted). A regular day of eating this one meal would be a post-workout protein shake/bar, Chicken usually as my main meat source of protein, or turkey, beef etc. when I can. A salad and veggies as well as often as I can to ensure I get my greens in and a good source of fibre! Then for desert or if I need to get more fibre in I will have a fibre bar, kale chips, granola bar, or protein ice cream, which are all high sources of fibre and taste great! If I am not doing OMAD, I will be doing Intermittent Fasting on usually a 2-4 hour window to eat, where I will have the aforementioned foods except more split up. I am not really a picky eater so this is what my diet mostly consists of.
Supplements:
-Ashwaganda (Pill form, one 650mg pill before workout when I need an extra energy boost)
-Kaizen Whey Isolate Protein (2 scoops @ 35g/scoop post-workout usually)
-ENGN Shred Pre-workout (1 scoop 15-30 minutes before workout)
Conclusion:
I have really grown mentally and although my weight loss journey isn’t done yet (roughly 30-50 pounds to lose) I am proud of what I have accomplished thus far. Through this weight loss, not only have I been able to get myself to live a way healthier lifestyle and improve my mental and physical health, but I have also found a true purpose and calling for once in my life. I plan to make as big of a positive impact as possible and help/inspire as many people as I can. This is just the beginning and I’m genuinely excited for what I have planned in the future! Thanks for reading, I have love for every single one of you and wish you all the most success on your journeys! :)
EDIT: Just got back from the gym to see all the support you guys left me... and wow... I truly feel so grateful and blessed. To see all the love and support from people I don’t even know, some who are genuinely happy and proud of me... it’s something I will never take for granted. What makes me even more happy and content is how many people who are struggling with the same issues I am/was and were positively impacted by this or got that extra push they needed to keep going... to keep pushing despite all the hardships they may encounter. I just feel so blessed to have this opportunity and seriously have love for all of you. Honestly, it feels amazing to not only be recognized for all the hard work, and literal blood, sweat, and tears that led me to this point, but also be able to inspire and motivate others to work towards a better and healthier version of themselves. I promise this is only the beginning, and I will do the best I can to lead by example and make as much of a positive impact as I possibly can. And for those who were inspired/motivated by my journey and are currently facing adversity, you have to do it yourself, you must realize your potential, that potential which we all possess inside of us, and become the best version of yourself you can be. I know it’s hard and might seem impossible at times, but trust me, it is very much possible, and very much worth it. Once again, thank you all for all of the support, I genuinely appreciate all of the love. Stay blessed, and best of luck on your journeys. 🙏❤️",

""best weight loss transformation of 2014""
. I'm back for another installment of my journey from fat to fit as requested by many of you. This is my third installment of my journey. Here is the original post from last year:
Clinically obese(class II) to ripped
My goal for this is to offer a simple blueprint that anyone can use. When I first began this journey i had no idea where to start. I'm going to highlight all my strategies that have worked in the hopes of helping someone who is in a similar predicament.

Recap and update
Back in 2011 I was an
obese, depressed, alcoholic, smoker.
After becoming fed up with my sloppyness and lack of dates, I started dieting and
running on a treadmill.
I lost 80lbs, quit smoking and drinking and got
really skinny.
Having lost so much weight, I had accumulated some
loose skin.
Luckily, I am privileged enough to afford the surgery to remove said skin so I took the dive and
got the surgery.
After the skin had gone I finally felt I could achieve a beach body and decided to enter a physique competition, more as a challenge to myself than anything else.
Here I am on stage in October at the Iron Man Natural.
Here is the full album from the event.
Since the competition I have transitioned into my first
intentional
bulk ever. The mental aspect of this is incredibly difficult. Keep in mind I have been dieting consistently for almost 4 years. To reverse that mentality and actually welcome weight gain has proven to be a challenge.
The beginning of the bulk was awesome. I was still lean from my competition but started filling out from the increased calories.
This gym selfie
I took got featured on a fitness motivation
Instagram account.
At the beginning of this year my local gym asked me if I would model for them as they needed pics for a new gym website. I wasn't expecting this opportunity and was not as lean as I would have liked. I agreed to the photo shoot and tried my best to dehydrate and carb load.
Here is the full album.
Diet
I've tried almost every diet and had some success with a few of them but the philosophy I choose to follow today is that of IIFYM or counting macros.
Counting macros is not a diet per se but more a way of eating that makes you aware of what you are ingesting. To count macros you use a calorie counter to track all the foods you eat and then look at the macro nutrient breakdowns of those foods and eat in an intentional way that will hit your goal number of carbs, fats and proteins. In this way you can still subscribe to a more food specific diet but doing so with this strategy makes you conscious of your macros.
For my show prep I did a classic bodybuilder prep diet consisting of tilapia, brown rice and broccoli. Although I was not IIFYM dieting, I did calculate the macros to be
45 fat, 145 carb and 225 protein(1,885 calories)
. I got incredibly lean doing this but it was unnecessarily difficult.
After the competition I began increasing my calories slowly by about 15 carbs and 3 fats a week. This is called a reverse diet and it's purpose is to allow your body to adjust to increased calories without putting on excess fat. My current lean bulking macros are
60 fat, 400 carb and 200 protein(2,940 calories)
. I've gained a total of 20lbs since beginning this increase.
Start
and
now
Supplements:
creatine, fish oil, multivitamin. I have never used steroids or pro-hormones.
Training
Towards the end of my show prep, when I was reaching low single digit body fat percentages, my strength took a steep dive. Since my show, I have been focusing much of my time in the gym on strength.
I do Jim Wendler's Boring But Big 5/3/1 strength protocol. Here is a link to
the program
and the
5/3/1 calculator
. This program is for intermediate lifters. My favorite beginner program is ICF 5x5.
Here is a graphic with the specific exercises

OHP: 145lb
Squat: 315lb
Bench: 240lb

Motivation
""How do you stay motivated?""
This is the most frequent question I've received from my reddit posts and it’s difficult to answer.
Originally my motivation was to look better and not be ignored by girls. This kept me going for a while but if that were my only motivation I would have fallen off a long time ago. Today my motivation is intrinsic, it comes from within. Lifting weights is part of who I am. It’s not something I try to get out of the way any more. I cherish my time in the gym.
In the early days, to get through times of low motivation, I made the gym part of my routine. If I didn't think about it, I wouldn't think my way out of it. After work everyday I went to the gym on my way home. Instead of being home from work at 4:30, I was home at 5:30 because I went to the gym first. Making myself go was the hardest part.
Things I wish I had known
Cardio<Weights<Diet
- This is the order of importance if an aesthetically appealing physique is the goal. Diet is the most important part of gaining or losing weight. To gain or lose weight in order to achieve an aesthetic figure, weight training is paramount. Cardio is a tool to use in conjunction with diet and weights to help achieve a caloric deficit.
Tracking
- If your goal is to achieve an aesthetic physique, tracking is a must. Tracking your diet, body weight and the weights you lift gives you the ability to view progress and analyze the variables. Being able to manipulate these variables is essential to break through plateaus. MyFitnessPal is great for tracking.
A couple years ago I was sitting on my computer reading posts like this one, wondering if it was possible for me to do the same thing. It
was
possible for me and it
is
possible for you too. I am not naturally a fit person. The success I have found has come from consistent positive choices.
If you are thinking about starting your own fitness journey,
DO IT
. You'll be glad you did. The way I feel is great, the way I look is awesome but the biggest difference is the way I'm treated today. I feel a sense of respect from complete strangers and people seem to
WANT
to talk to me. I'm still getting used to it, but it's awesome.
I'll answer any questions you may have. I'm an open book. I have no secrets.

Recap
Back in 2011 I was diagnosed as prediabetic and
clinically obese
.
I wanted to lose weight so I started lifting weights and tracking macros.
I lost 80lbs and was left with
loose skin
and got it
surgically removed
.
After the skin was gone, I decided I could finally get over my fear of taking my shirt off in public, so I entered a
bodybuilding competition
.
Update
The bulk
- After the competition, I decided I wanted to add size and get stronger, so I started eating in a way that would increase my bodyweight and in turn also increase my strength and size. This is called
bulking
.
The first bulk got out of hand
. Although my strength had incresed a lot, when I cut down I realized that
I hadn't gained much size
.
Controlled surplus
- I learned that the amount of muscle I grew during a bulk was not necessarily proportionate to the amount of weight I was gaining. Our bodies can only create a small amount of muscle at a time, so there is no benefit to being in a large surplus of calories versus a smaller surplus of calories. The only difference is the amount of fat that is stored in addition to the muscle in a larger surplus. The important thing is to be in a surplus. This means taking in more calories than you expend in order to allow your body to adapt and get bigger and stronger.
Current condition
- I have since been bulking and cutting for a couple years. I have found a groove where I relax my diet during the winter months and eat how I want while tracking my macros to make sure I am getting sufficient protein. As a naturally fat person, this results in weight gain. I then cut during the spring or summer months. Here is my most recent
winter bulk (8 months) and summer cut (10 weeks)
Diet
As a formerly obese person, I have tried or been prescribed just about every diet out there. What I have found to be most effective is the idea of energy balance. If your goal is to gain weight, you must eat more than your body requires. This is a caloric surplus. If you want to lose weight, you need to eat less than your body requires. This is a caloric deficit. If you want to maintain your bodyweight, you must eat around the amount your body expends in a day. This is called maintenance.
Maintenance
- In order to diet (gaining or losing) you must first find your maintenance calories. You can use a calorie calculator like
this one
to help estimate this number but this is only an estimate and you will need to use trial and error to find your own personal maintenance.
Tracking weight
- How I find my maintenance calorie intake is by weighing myself daily and taking my weekly averages. If my average weight from 2 consecutive weeks is around the same, I have found my maintenance calories. It is a moving target and will not be the same at the end of a cut as it was at the beginning of a cut.
Tracking calories
- Once I know my maintenance calories, I can gain weight by adding calories to that number or lose weight by subtracting. When I begin a gaining or losing phase, I always start with increments of 500 calories at a time added onto my daily calorie goals. If I was maintaining my weight on 2500 calories a day, I would begin my diet on 2,000. I subtract these calories from carbs and fats. The tricky part is tracking accurately. I use
MyFitnessPal
.
Macros -
In a caloric surplus, as long as I am getting enough protein (0.8 to 1 gram per lb of bodyweight), it does not matter where the rest of the calories come from. In a deficit on the other hand, it can be important. If I am dieting, I always make sure to have at least 50 to 60 grams of fat. I have gone below 50 and I felt horrible. I keep my protein static year round and I eat as many carbs as my goals will allow. I like food.
bulking macros
: 450 carb/190 protein/75 fat
cutting macros
: 250 carb/190 protein/60 fat
Supplements:
creatine, fish oil, multivitamin, whey. I have never used steroids.
Training
Strength training
To increase size and strength it is necessary to practice progressive overload. This is the idea of handling a higher workload overtime. The easiest way to do this is by focusing on strength. For this reason, I suggest starting out with a strength routine. I have done a couple strength routines in the past including
5/3/1
and
Starting Strength
. These are great routines.
Bodybuilding
- Over my lifting career, I have gravitated towards bodybuilder style lifting. I lift relatively heavy weights with an emphasis on stretching the muscle at one end of the rep and squeezing the muscle at the other end. I find that I feel good doing this and do not get injured. Most importantly, I enjoy it. By doing this day in and day out, I do gain strength (progressive overload) although not nearly as quickly as I would with a strength routine.
Current maxes:
OHP: 185lb 1RM
Squat: 365lb 3RM
Bench: 275lb 3RM
DL: 405lb (last tested over a year ago)
But how??
""How do I motivate myself?""
This is the most frequent question I've received from my reddit posts and it’s difficult to answer. I don't know what motivates anyone else. For me, I got sick and tired of being sick and tired. I read every transformation post on
r/fitness
over and over again until I had an idea of what to do and I finally took action. After that, I fell in love with this lifestyle. I no longer need to stay motivated because this is just what I like to do.
Make it routine
- When I was obese, I worked 40 hours a week and was very tired when I got home. The last thing I wanted to do was drive another 20 minutes to the gym. What I did instead was brought my gym clothes with me to work. I changed in the bathroom at work and stopped at the gym on my way home. This way it wasn't a choice. I did not need strong willpower every day. It was just part of my routine. The hardest part is often just getting to the gym.
Lessons learned
Cardio is not necessary for weightloss
- In the begining of my journey,
I ran on an elliptical every day and I hated it
. What I didn't know at the time was the idea of energy balance. Cardio worked because it increased my daily energy expenditure and forced me into a deficit. What I wish I had known was that those 300 calories I was burning every day on the elliptical could have just as easily come out of my diet. One less pop tart would have had the exact same affect on my physique.
Tracking accurately
- Diet is the most important aspect of fitness. The way we look, feel and perform comes down to diet above all else. In order to control this aspect, it is important to be able to track it accurately. For me, this took a lot of practice. A behavior of mine that contributed to my obesity and still hinders my diet sometimes is unconscious eating. I stand in front of the fridge or a cupboard and shovel food into my mouth without even recognizing it. By tracking everything that enters my mouth I am able to recognize unconscious eating and stop myself before I start. Tracking my diet, body weight, pictures and the weights I lift also gives me the ability to view progress and analyze variables. Being able to manipulate these variables is essential to achieving my goals.
If you are thinking about getting started on your own fitness journey, do yourself a favor and begin today. My only regret is not starting sooner. I have found a new way of life in fitness and it has allowed me to achieve things I didn't think were possible for me. Thanks again for all the support. I am truly grateful for this subreddit.
Ask any questions you may have. I will do my best to answer every last one.

For my diet plan I consumed at least 2k calories a day or more and my diet isn't really that fancy, I stay away from fried foods, noodles, rice, and really fattening foods on the week days and i definitely stay away from junk food/fast foods and soda and I usually eat grilled meats like chicken beef, etc I also eat salads, grilled vegetables and sometimes fish and I have little cheat days on the weekends where I eat meals that includes grilled meats on top of rice and Sundays are my full cheat days where I'll eat whatever I want and not go to hard of course!
This has really been a spiritual journey for me, because I have been over weight my whole entire life. I got laughed at, made fun of, and got joked about and it never felt good, then years passed by when i got my first job and they hosted a weight loss competition and I was like you know what lets try it and finally had the courage to sign up for a gym membership. At first it was going good and lost 60 lbs and felt impressed with my self, the results came in and i lost and felt devastated and lost motivation. My friends still encourage me and said ""you know even though you lost you still lost 60 lbs which is incredible you should still keep trying!"" and I was like ""you know what? you guys are right!"" So I tried going back, but it felt different, I didn't feel the same motivation as I did before and I didn't last long and kept on failing over and over and started to slowly gain my weight back and was depressed and went MIA. because I felt so ashamed. Years passed by and I moved to Saint Louis to work at my cousins restaurant to start my life anew, to find myself and then one night...I skyped with one of my best friends and when I saw him I was so shocked, because he been trying to get fit too and he looked amazing, he progressed so much and I was like wow....and we talked and he gave me good advice encouraging me and etc. All night I was thinking ""wow....I'm really jealous, think i could've looked like that? what if I never gave up, what if I actually stayed on tracked..I don't think I can do it.."" but the next morning something happened..I felt something different inside me and I was like you know what....I don't wanna feel this way anymore! No more What ifs! I'm going to get my ass up and go back to the gym! The first week there....I finally felt it...the motivation that I had before except this time it was stronger, this time I'm not going to give up, I won't fail this time, I'm going to turn those dreams into reality and I felt an endless amount of motivation flowing inside of me and was able to push my self beyond my limits and even surpassed my weight goal of 200 and got to 190 and i feel great!
I made a facebook video telling my whole story here, because I want to encourage people to never give up and achieve their goals!

No matter how many times you fall, always find the courage to stand back up again and keep pushing forward! I know I still got ways to go, but I promise I won't stop here and will keep on going strong because I do have some loose skin that I need to convert to muscle now and I won't give up!
Never Give up, Believe in yourself!

All About the Keto Diet: A Beginners Guide
Edit: The post was removed due to some
self-promotion rules.
SO I must adhere to them by probably summarizing the content of a 9000 word article. Okay so here goes:
What is the ketogenic (keto) diet?
The ketogenic diet is not intended to be a temporary diet for weight loss, although it works great for that, but it is more of a lifestyle change where you consistently and drastically reduce the amount of carbs you ingest. It not only makes you burn fat for energy (more on that below) but helps you become very aware of how rampant and ubiquitous carbs are in this day and age.
Why is it called ketogenic?
The word ketogenic is made up of two words: keto- and -genic.
The prefix “keto-” is short for ketones.
The suffix “-genic” is the same as genesis, which refers to “the creation of something”
So the word ketogenic literally means the “creation of ketones.”
Ketones are created from the break down of fat for energy when the body doesn’t get enough carbs.
When the body is creating ketones, it is said to be in a state of ketosis where fat becomes the main source of fuel for energy rather than sugar (glycolysis).
What the fuck are ketones?
Ketones are like water-soluble fat molecules that can cross the blood-brain-barrier and provide energy for the brain.  There is this myth where people say that you MUST eat carbs because the brain can only survive off carbs or glucose. What they don’t know (or conveniently forget to mention) is that the brain operates perfectly on ketones as well.  Think of them as the 4th macronutrient after carbs, protein and fat.
How is ketosis achieved?
Ketosis is achieved by practicing strict carbohydrate restriction consistently. The general limit is about 25-50grams of net carbs a day which is far lower than the typical 200-300grams most people ingest per day.  (Net carbs are carbs minus fiber.) Those carbs must be replaced with healthy fat sources. It takes a few days for ketosis to actually occur because you have a glycogen supply to get through initially, but one can reach ketosis faster if they exercise.
Note: One can also reach ketosis if they starve themselves completely of all foods, but that is not ideal or recommended. What we're after is not starvational ketosis but nutritional ketosis which is achieved in the same fashion by simply restricting carbs.
What are the benefits of being in ketosis?
The promises of a ketogenic diet are quite impressive:
Helpful for metabolic syndrome (obesity) and preventing diabetes
Increased meal satiety and appetite blunting. This diet is more satiating than a low-fat diet and tends to makes it easier to avoid caloric overconsumption.
Greater rate of fat loss due to state of ketosis rather than glycolysis.
Note: You literally become a fat-burning machine.
Reduction or complete elimination of Type-2 Diabetes (Reduction in insulin resistance)
Reduction or complete elimination of hypertension (high blood pressure).
Improved lipid fat profile: LDL (the bad cholesterol) particle size increases which is a good thing. (The smaller ones cause more damage.)
The SIZE of LDL particles may be more important than concentration of LDL cholesterol.
Recent studies have shown independent relationships of levels of LDL size to risk of heart disease.
Prevention of various cancers and reduction of cancer growths.
The mitochondria of cancer cells are damaged and require 200x the normal amounts of glucose to replicate at rapid rates. They cannot utilize ketones and cannot survive in ketosis without the presence of excess glucose.
Possible treatment for Alzheimers.
(
another study)
Possible treatment for Parkinsons
Improved memory for older adults
Reduction or complete elimination of chronic systemic inflammation.
A ketogenic diet has profoundly anti-inflammatory effects.
Improved cardiovascular health
Very high muscle-sparing effect. (Muscle loss is mitigated in ketosis even at a caloric deficit!)
Proven treatment for epilepsy, more effective than current medications without the side effects.
You can extrapolate that if it’s helping reverse the diseased conditions of people with Type 2 diabetes, cancer, heart disease, epilepsy, Alzheimer’s and so forth, that it may PROACTIVELY help those of us who are not afflicted by those conditions and want to avoid them!
Before I continue: The ketogenic diet is NOT a panacea
The truth is that there is not a single, perfect diet that works for everybody.  In regards to this diet specifically,
Dom D’agostino
says that this diet is excellent for ~70% of people out there but ~30% of the population does not respond well to this diet. Btw, Dom D’agostino is the expert that originally got me hooked to trying keto. He calls ketones the 4th macronutrient in
this podcast with Tim Ferris.
Weight loss is NOT guaranteed on keto. You still need to be wary of your total intake of calories and counting your calories/macros is recommended until you figure out the diet. But after a lot of experience, many people find the keto diet to be liberating because they are able to maintain the diet without the need for calorie counting by consistently choosing only keto-friendly foods.
Why do you have to restrict the carbs so sharply? How does the body transition to burning fats for energy?
I wrote a ton on that topic and I'm just summarizing here so here's a tl;dr infographic:
http://i.imgur.com/HeEYexT.png
So… What are carbohydrates?
Carbs are sugar. Sugars are carbs.  There are simple carbs (monosaccharides) and complex carbs (polysaccharides). There are also sugars found naturally in foods and extra sugars added artificially to foods. In the context of a ketogenic diet, they’re all pretty much the same because the body eventually breaks them down into their simplest forms regardless. (The carbs that you will eat will come almost entirely from veggies or nuts on this diet.)
Don't we need carbs for energy?
Despite your body needing to break down carbs first and foremost when they are ingested, carbs are NOT an essential nutrient.  An essential nutrient is one your body needs to survive because it won’t be able to make it on its own.  But your body readily creates sugar from fat and protein to regulate blood sugar levels.
Many people think they need carbs to perform at their very best performance-wise, but that’s not true either. It takes a few weeks, but after someone becomes completely adapted to the ketogenic diet, they become very, very efficient at burning fats for fuel and the bandwidth or throughput within which your body can do this at is great. It’s been ingrained in us that we need carbs to survive, or perform at our peak as athletes. We see sugar as energy. We see athletes drink Gatorade, so we think we can’t perform at our best without it. We almost rely on it as a crutch. But when you’re keto-adapted you are not chained to the hypoglycemic rollercoaster.
I'm only a quarter way through the article and it's only summarized the key points but the rest of the article talks about
What's wrong with carbs

And please remember that diets are an extremely complex subject. There is no perfect diet and it's not all about just doing something for weight loss. Diet is influenced by culture, religion, social influence, family, ethics... for some it's as simply as drinking soylent and nothing more. For some, they view it through a lens of biochemistry and physiology and geek out over metabolically hacking their body. It's all about finding out what works for you. On the keto diet, I was able to sleep well and have good recovery between strength/skill training sessions and felt a constant state of mental focus (I still do, I've been keto for like 3 months straight now with 5 months total experience), so it's nice to be able to share what it's all about, in case it jives with anyone.",

Wise words from Purple Spengler:
""There was a time in my life when I was the biggest World of Warcraft nerd that you can imagine. It was around the middle of the second expansion that I got exposed to the concept of ""theorycrafting"" or ""min/maxing"" and it revolutionized how I played not just that game, but all games. Instead of simply playing the game, I also played a meta-game of spreadsheets, equations, simulators, math, numbers, and I was able to achieve character power and success I never had before. I lay this groundwork so that what I am about to say can land more strongly - because I am a nerd, and not just a dummy meathead or whatever who is shouting and drooling.
Nerds ruin everything.
It's been a long time since my WoW min/maxing obsession days but I still remember how to think that way. And it's because I do that when I read questions like this:
What's better for functional strength - powerlifting, bodybuilding, or strongman?
Should I do 5/3/1 or GZCL?
How can I optimize my PPL routine?
When do you become an intermediate?
All I see is this:
Should I play a Warlock or a Mage or a Shadow Priest?
Should I be Arms or Fury?
What's the Best in Slot gear at Tier 9 for my Ret Paladin? (fuckin' rerolling, that's what)
Is my gearscore high enough to do Heroic ICC?
To put it in the vernacular: Hi, my name is John, and I hate every single one of you.
If you're not familiar with the term ""min/maxing"", it's shorthand for ""minimizing weaknesses / maximizing strengths"". The concept is to build the most powerful possible character with what you've got, often also determining the best things to get. In practice, what this boils down to is little more than doing a bunch of math, which works out pretty well because that's what many games, especially RPGs, are based on. And for the most part this strategy is incredibly successful, across many different games. There are parts of it that can even be applied to aspects of real life with success. So people get into a habit of thinking this way. And then they get into lifting, and try to think the same way.
But there's a problem - Lifting is not a fucking video game. And you people need to stop, because you are driving the rest of us insane.
Min/Maxing is touted as being a strategy for making strong characters. But in my opinion, what it's really about is removing as much effort from gameplay as possible. This does not just apply to the dudes who make twinks (not that kind) to steamroll the game. Even for people who try to build the most powerful characters so that they can tackle the hardest possible content are still, ultimately, trying to reduce their effort level. Fundamentally, min/maxing is about trying to front-load effort through thinking, doing math, planning, and acquiring the right gear, to reduce the impact that their gameplay can have on their success. It is about determining the perfect way to create a character that can be as successful as possible, as quickly as possible, just by virtue of knowing all the pieces, where they come from, and exactly how you will acquire them and in what order, in advance, before you even truly do anything in the game itself.
Does
this
sound
familiar
to
anyone?
This is reason number one that lifting cannot be treated like a video game. The 80/20 rule is out in force, and for my money one of the top three of what gets you the 80% (it's really more like 90, IMO), alongside consistency and time, is effort. Min/maxing is about transmuting future effort in execution into present effort in planning, so that by the latter you have reduced how much is required in the former. But this is backwards and wrong. Success in lifting is heavily tied to effort in execution, and only tenuously at best to effort in planning. Focusing on having a ""perfect"" training and diet plan while leaving the execution of that plan as a given is flawed at best and self-sabotage at worst. I've said this so many different ways that I feel like a broken record, but I truly believe it needs to be hammered on again and again - effort trumps intelligence. The time to focus on your effort and execution is not after you have created a great plan and it fails, as you would when min/maxing, it is from Day 1.
It sounds stupid to have to say that video games are nothing like real life, but apparently on some level people don't understand this, and it is reason number two to please for everyone's sanity stop treating lifting like an MMO. The entire practice of min/maxing hinges completely and 100% on all inner workings of the game being both completely knowable and infinitely replicable. If DickSocks69 puts the same gear on his character as WarlockMasterXXX, the math and equations that determine their characters' potential damage will always be exactly the same. And both of them can always know exactly what those equations are, how any of the potential random factors average out on a certain timescale, and even what the most optimal rotation or priority list of spellcasting is. But human beings are not RPG characters that are built on math equations. You cannot take Jim and Bill and put them on identical training and dietary plans and have their results be exactly the same. Ever. There is simply too much variance at every possible level and too many factors that are unknowable. This should be obvious, but every single day people behave as though they don't understand that they are not an Orc Warlock.
Finally, there is an inherent attitude of min/maxing that is incompatible with the pursuit of lifting. As always, the context of this is having actual goals. The attitude I mean has many facets and can be described in a many ways, but one I feel that captures a lot of them is ""When can I stop?"" Part of the strategy of min/maxing is about minimizing the grind from character creation to the highest levels, and acquiring the best gear as rapidly as possible, because it is not until this point that ""the real game actually starts"". Min/maxing treats the process of a character growing as a waste of your time, a barrier that must be torn down. If you think of leveling up or iteratively improving the power of your gear as a parallel for training, it becomes about trying to skip as much training as possible.
But this, again, is completely backwards, and ties back in to the first point about effort avoidance. Skipping training is wrong - You want to train more, not less. In a game, you can come up with character builds that manipulate numbers and allow you to walk into a level, lay waste to it, and rapidly advance through the game. But there is no such thing as a secret training and diet plan that is so well planned out, so firmly based in science, that it removes so much effort while giving you such rapid results - because effort and time are primary drivers in results. You can't, through the magic of perfect exercise and food selection, skip the years of consistency and effort it takes most people to achieve their true goals, in the way you can blast from Level 1 to 90 by dumping a bunch of +Experience Gain gear onto your character.
I see this way of thinking fuck with people constantly. Everyone I've ever tried to help with any fitness goal who was a nerd first, they have this exact same problem. And I say all this because I have been there too, and for me, it was only because I figured out how to break myself that I ever got down to the brass tacks of actually busting my balls in training and accomplished anything real. The challenge is not simply to understand that this way of thinking is not compatible with every pursuit, and why, but it is more importantly about learning how to find the switch in your head so you can turn it off sometimes. I don't have any advice to offer there other than to say that I know there's a switch because I found it. But I've only got a map for my own head.""

For the first eighteen months of this, I was kind of winging it at the gym and just trying to eat right to the best of my ability. I plateaued at ~175 lbs and couldn't seem to make much more progress. It was then that I began seriously reading these forums and discovered all types of things involving nutrition and fitness; most importantly, counting calories. I decided I wanted my abs to be visible. I learned that for this to be possible, a body fat of ~10% or less was required. So in June, I downloaded MyFitnessPal and began counting my calories. It was also then that I adopted a vegan ""diet"", at first for nutritional benefits, and now for all sorts of reasons.
My average caloric intake over this period ranged from 1,500 to 2,300 per day; I was experimenting for the first three months or so. Now it seems as though 1,800 - 2,000 allows me to lose the amount of fat that I'm comfortable with. Here are my most current dietary goals:

Breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks weren't planned whatsoever. I would pretty much just eat throughout the day whenever I was hungry. The key was sticking to reasonably low calorie foods and keeping the cheat meals at a minimum:
Cereal
Bananas
Baked beans
Boca burgers
Gardein products
Tofurkey products
NuGo protein bars
White or brown rice
Lightlife smart dogs
Steam-in-bag vegetables
Soy, almond, coconut, and flax milk
CHEATING:
Whiskey
Craft beer
Taco Bell (I know)
Diet soda (not really a cheat, but kept my sanity)
SUPPLEMENTS:
Creatine
Beta Alanine
Various types of soy, rice, pea, and hemp protein powders
EXERCISE
I've been doing PPL (Push/Pull/Legs) for the last seven weeks, with this last one consisting of a deloading phase. Here are my daily routines for the first six weeks:
MONDAY:
PUSH (chest / shoulders / triceps)
Bench: 195 lbs (5x5)
Shoulder Press: 90 lbs (5x5)
Tricep Pulldown: 60 lbs (5x5)
1-3 mile run

REFLECTIONS, LESSONS LEARNED, & ADVICE
To be brief, there are two very specific things that influenced my change and neither of them involve fitness. If you care to know, they are the films of
Terrence Malick
and the music of
Tool
, specifically ""
Lateralus
"".
I mention those unrelated influences to highlight the fact that a desire for a ""nice body"" isn't necessarily a prerequisite to significant physical, mental, or emotional health. I wanted my
life
to improve. Those two things were my conduit, but I soon did realize that my health would eventually need to improve at least
somewhat
for me to be comfortable. Hell, my original goal weight was 185! When I reached that, I kept going. I felt a hunger and addiction because the results were tangible and I could feel myself changing in every single way, all for the better.
In reading these forums, the one thing I've taken away is this:
Do not believe everything you read here or anywhere else
. There are absolutely wonderful things here, especially in the FAQ, and certainly from various posts I've read over the last six months; but do not believe or adhere to any one thing.
Experiment
with your own body. Do not be discouraged if something is working wonderfully for someone but doesn't seem right for you. It's incredibly discouraging to strive so hard at something and fail miserably. I will tell you that I've tried countless different exercises and routines (both dietary and physical) and am just now starting to figure my body out.
A long time ago I read someone say, ""Anyone who has exercised for less than five years is a beginner."", and I called complete bullshit on that statement. Now, though, two years into this myself, I am starting to see his point. Your body is so complex that it's utterly mind-boggling. So many people want such a quick fix. It simply doesn't work that way. It takes effort. It takes time. It takes dedication. If you allow these three things to work in conjunction with one another, you
will
see and feel results.
MOVING FORWARD
This week I have started a 'clean, slow' bulk. That is to say, I'm eating 250 cals above maintenance, upping my protein, and following P.H.U.L. (Power-Hypertrophy-Upper-Lower). My plan is to do this for three months, cut back down for three more, and see what I've managed to accomplish. I have never been more excited about any aspect of my life than I am for these next six months. Although it was not the original spark, fitness has absolutely changed my life. Thanks for reading.

""Do you have trouble getting protein being a vegan?""
No.
""Juice!""
No.
""Your lifts look like shit and -insert broism here-""
My lifts were for maintenance purposes only and were set at very moderate weights accordingly. Most of my focus was on diet and cardio.
""Did you drink alcohol?""
Yes, but put limits on myself. One craft beer per night, tops, with one or two small glasses of whiskey, tops. I plan on cutting it down to the weekends during this bulk.
""Do you have loose skin?""
Yes, but pretty minimal. It is visible when I sit down.
""How much could you run when you first started out?""
For the first month or so I was unable to even run for 10 straight minutes. Consistency is key. I can do a 10k without being remotely winded, now.
""Should I do cardio before or after weights?""
In my experience, absolutely after weights. This does not apply to leg day, though. Don't do that.",

Background
I’ve been going to the gym regularly for most of my adult life but it wasn’t until March 2019 that I decided to seriously take a look and dedicate time to understanding my body and seek assistance for diet, macro counting, and splits.
I thought I could do this work on my own but when my macro counting has been terrible. I didn’t know how to do this, it was overwhelming, and quite honestly not very intuitive to macro count. I was putting waaaay too much into my body, and when the scale kept going up, I truly wondered why my body wasn't changing the way I wanted (frankly, NEEDED) it to do.
My lifestyle was fairly sedentary, I’d go hiking occasionally but outside of the gym 5 times a week, I didn’t do much but sit even when I got home.
From 03/02/2019 - 07/15/2019 my days have been twice a day at the gym, early morning target cardio (plan below and what that means) and then heavy lifting in the afternoon. Depending on how I feel, this is usually six days a week.
Current Lifestyle
I’m a software consultant, sitting behind a desk 5 days a week. My life, outside of working out two times a day, six days a week, is pretty sedentary, even today, so I have to be hyper aware of my nutrition and ensure that my food intake is as clean as possible.
Actual Workout
(03/02/2019 - 07/01/2019)
At the beginning from March through June, I was hitting every major muscle group around once a week. My splits would look something like:
Day 1: Legs
Day 2: Delts + Target Cardio
Day 3: Back
Day 4: Chest + Target Cardio
Day 5: Arms
Day 6: Delts - because they’re STUBBORN + Target Cardio
Day 7: High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) Cardio
07/02/2019 - Present
Tracking the photos, I knew what areas were weakest. My trainer put a plan in place to help adjust to focus more on my weaker areas so my splits changed. Also note: I added targeted cardio daily to the workout routine to help cut more. Cardio consists of
at least
45-mins targeting heart rate at 115 - 135 bpm, my body's fat burn zone. Side note: targeted cardio can be done walking on a treadmill, it's boring, so find some music, tv, anything to get through it.
The other thing is what works for me, may not work for you. Know your body, its limits, and what you can accomplish and what areas you need to focus on. My trainer has been a huge asset in helping me understanding my own body and what areas I need to work on.
Day 1: Legs + Mid-back; Target cardio
Day 2: Chest; Target cardio
Day 3: Back/biceps (lat dominant); Target cardio
Day 4: Delts/core; Target cardio
Day 5: Legs/triceps; Target cardio
Day 6: Chest/light delts; Target cardio
Day 7: High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) Cardio; abs
My delts and lats continue to be pretty stubborn and I'm slowly realizing I'll always have to go after them in the gym multiple times a week.
Overall diet
I am a creature of habit, my diet is pretty boring, especially when I find something good I usually keep it in my week. For that reason, I’m just going to show my macro counts because I’m not eating anything special.
I adjust my macro intake based on what muscle group I’m working on. Larger muscle groups will have higher carbs and protein; smaller groups will be higher fats and protein, low carbs.
Back and Legs (Large muscle group)
-  I try to consume around 1734 Kcal, which will consist of 46% Carbs; 46% proteins; 24% fats.
Arms/rest day (smaller muscle group) -
Calories: 1562 Kcal, which consists of 26% carbs; 32% proteins; 42% fats
Chest/delts (smaller muscle group) -
Calories: 1728 Kcal, which consists of 27% carbs; 30% proteins 43% fats.
GET A FOOD SCALE. GAME. CHANGER.
Meal prep in general is a struggle for me, it takes me about two hours overall on a Sunday. I know, not that much,  but my god, time is so limited, that’s the last thing I want to do. So crafting recipes that I can throw in a slow cooker, rice maker, insta pot has been a life saver.
Supplements
: I take
L-Carnitine
for fasted cardio;
L-Arginine
(3g) pre-workout;
BCAA
(5g) 3:1:1 ratio during the workout; G
lutamine
(5g) post workout;
Glucosamine
before bed.
Super greens powder
for when I didn’t feel like I didn’t eat enough vegetables that day.
My Thoughts / Takeaways
So I’m a little more than four months in and I’m scared. I don’t want to go back to that person I was in March. It’s such a short amount of time I’m scared that I could go back to that person any minute. I know I won’t be able to maintain these incredible results long term - it’s going to get harder and come more slowly, so I know I have to readjust my expectations. Seeing the current results and progress is so addicting. I love seeing my body transform. It’s like a science experiment where I get to experience the results first hand.
I feel incredible - I have more energy, more stamina, I fall asleep in 5-mins when I go to bed. I was always hitting high blood pressure for my age and I check my blood pressure periodically and my blood pressure is all in the normal ranges now.
The biggest challenge of this process is knowing and being honest with myself. Six days a week, twice a day, is very hard. I may feel like shit after a day at work and I have to know my body - am I fighting exhaustion or am I just in a bad mood? If it’s exhaustion, it’s fine, I can take a day to break or I can go after a nap and it’s going to be alright.
Another challenge behind this is the social aspect. People are mean when it comes to this journey! Socializing, going to dinner and drinks after work, I will find anything on the menu to fit my dietary needs for the day. I don’t want to put anyone out, but I often find people don’t like it when I say I’m going to eat a salad, or I won’t drink alcohol at a happy hour. I can brush it off for now. If you have thoughts behind this, please let me know! I’m still learning and would love to know your thoughts.",

Here’s my lessons learned so far.","At the end of last year, I read a book titled Living with a Seal, where the author had a Navy Seal move him with him and his family for 31 days. His reason for doing this:
I felt like I was drifting on autopilot in my life. Wake up, go to work, go to the gym — repeat. I wanted to shake things up. I wanted to get better.
That really resonated with me. I’m sure a ton of other people in here feel the same exact way. We get stuck in the same routines in life, and in the gym. So I knew that I wanted to find a fitness challenge this year.
At the same time, I remember reading about The Rock’s workout and nutrition program in Muscle & Fitness last spring. I was fascinated that he was able to do that. We all sort of write it off like “oh, but he has trainers and a private chef or takes illegal substances” but at the end of the day, that’s a ton of commitment and dedication. And he has done is while his career absolutely exploded over the last few years.
I decided to see if I could do the same thing, see how I measure up. This isn’t about following a fitness and eating plan that’s optimized for me. It seemed like too much food for a guy my size. It’s also not about using this plan for specific results. I have no desire to look like The Rock. It was just about “can I do this really hard thing this successful guy does while living a normal life?”

I’ve made it more than half-way through already, and am currently on Day 17. It isn’t easy, all about just keeping the discipline and grinding through it.
Things I’ve Learned
The hardest part actually is the food prep: having to make 7 meals a day, every day, for month is hard to do with a full-time job and a family to take care of. if anyone is interested, I can share more details about this.
Though I’m 6’3”/207lbs and The Rock is 6’5”/260lbs, I haven’t gained any weight eating 5,000 calories a day. I would have thought at this surplus it would have led to putting on some weight. But I’m noticeably building muscle while getting leaner.
Podcasts and Audiobooks! This is how I spend 2+ hours in the gym 6 days a week. Music just doesn’t hold my focus for that amount of time. I also feel like I’m getting smarter and bettering myself in the process.
I feel great. I’m 37, around the time when mysterious aches and pains pop up. Eating like this is preventing any muscle soreness or DOMS. And I’m lifting heavier than I had in awhile. Makes me realize I definitely haven’t been eating enough, and that sometimes your body needs high glycemic carbs (something I’ve avoided for years).
Eating like The Rock isn’t cheap. It’s costing me about $42/day, putting this whole experiment at a monthly budget of almost $1300. It’s mostly the cod that gets you, that alone is $18/day.
This experience has been eye-opening for me, especially how the nutrition is affecting my workout. Kind of blew apart some cutting/bulking views I had. Thought /Fitness would benefit from what I'm learning. Questions or comments? Fire away.

fitness,https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/54fphc/the_hip_flexors_are_the_muscles_near_the_front_of/,6586,399,"The ""hip flexors"" are the muscles near the front of the thighs and hips that help bring your knees UP toward your torso (and often tight from sitting). I made a video that teaches you how to perform the Perfect Lunge to Stretch them so you could get more hip extension!","In this follow-along video,
I share with you the intricacies that turn the lunge into a
very effective
stretch for your hip flexors which are the muscles at the front of the thigh/hips. The muscles such as the
rectus femoris
and the
iliopsoas complex.
)
Benefits:
For people who sit a lot and don't stretch the hip flexors, they have often lost all hip extension and need to restore it. Stretching the hip flexors will help your hips
have more hip extension
(read: the ability to bring your thighs behind you without arching the lower back to compensate).
Lunges are a commonly prescribed basic stretch if someone is having lower back pain, because the iliopsoas complex (deep hip flexor) connects the thighs to the lower back, and if they're tight they pull on the lower back. Doing it in a low lunge is a very good start toward stretching them.
The cues in the video (squaring, tucking, etc) are applicable to
ALL
hip flexor stretches, including high/standing lunges or the couch/wall quad stretch and so forth.

here's the version without background music.

I teach you how to square the hips (remember, it's always back-hip forward, front-hip backward), then my favorite way of getting people to tuck the hips (posteriorly tilt the hips using your hands) and small but important details like making sure the back foot is in line with the mat/carpet and the front foot is ahead of the knee and so on.
Edit: The support has been overwhelming...ly awesome! Thank You!

This year I am sharing swimming secrets of long time swimmers like myself that you never see written elsewhere and no-one explains","Hi all,
I am mod of
/r/swimming
and an experienced marathon swimmer (over thirty open water swims greater than 10k). 
I usually post some advice here each New Year to assist new and improvng swimmers, and people hoping to use swimming for exercise and weight management.
Swimming is a sport that when done consistently will allow you to pursue it for an entire lifetime and reward you for doing do.
/r/swimming
is a great resource, especially if you use the search bar, as there is almost no question that hasn't been asked and gotten an answer previously.
Here's last year advice
.
I've said previously that there are no tricks or secrets in learning to swim. But it’s not entirely accurate about other aspects of swimming. 
These are secrets in that experienced swimmers know them, but it can take a long time for others to learn. These are the nuggets of knowledge that get passed in changing rooms and on decks, and are part of what we might call swim culture.
This should help collect some of the “soft” knowledge that experienced swimmers gain over time and so many new and improving swimmers haven’t yet learned, especially if they are not part of a swim group.
Lane Etiquette
By far the most annoying thing for swimmers are people joining the lane who have no understanding of lane etiquette used around the world by experienced swimmers. Actually this often includes the lifeguards on duty many of whom (most in my experience)  don’t understand either.
Below are four simple rules. Yes, I know as a beginner you think this is too much, but people don’t play golf with a hockey stick, so I don’t know why non-swimmers think swimming is different.
Here is a comprehensive explanation of lane swimming etiquette  if you are inclined
.
* Ask or let the swimmer already in the lane know you are joining.
* Don’t start swimming or turn in front of a faster swimmer.
* The fastest swimmer has the right of way.
* Stay aware of what everyone is doing to avoid collisions and frustration for all.
Goggles
Because every swimmer in the world has an opinion and will happily entertain long discussions about goggs.
No anti-fog will last on goggles longer than a couple of months
Spit into googles for a simple reasonably effective anti-fog. Never touch the inside of the goggles.
Use a 2/3 water, 1/3 baby shampoo mix, swirl it around and rinse it out for a more effective anti-fog
Most “high visibility open water goggles” aren’t high visibility and are seriously over-priced. The google design offering the most visibility are clear Swedish goggles (aka Swedes). Which are also the cheapest.
More expensive goggles does not in any way mean better. Blame triathletes for the escalation of costs. The best goggles I’ve bought in years were €4 in Lidl the summer before last.
There is no such thing as a generic “best google” answer. Competitive swimmers/online swimmers most often respond Vanquishers  or Swedish Goggles. Vanquishers are not available in Europe anymore & Swedes (Which I wear myself in the pool and
I show you how to fit here
) aren’t a good idea for beginner swimmers. I also wrote
this article about understanding the different kinds of goggles
so you can choose based on your own requirements rather than other’s opinions, because I had never once seen anything like this by any of the goggle manufacturers, or anyone else.
Silicon straps don’t last long. Bungee straps are a great replacement.
Two thirds of my swimming time is spent with my face underwater exhaling. I can see everything including guys jerking off, teenagers and older couples fiddling with each other and numerous erections.
Technique (Front crawl)
The name of the stroke is front crawl. Freestyle means that in competition you can swim any stroke, and since crawl is the fastest, it (mostly) gets used, so a lot of swimmers think crawl is freestyle and visa versa. Someone will probably even say in the comments here that no-one calls it front crawl. Front crawl is extensively used outside the US and is the accurate term.
BLABT  is the acronym for the process most swim experienced teachers use to evaluate stroke and teach front crawl. It stands for:
B
ody position
Get horizontal in the water. Not being horizontal is the most common reason for swimming slow.
Push your chest forward and down into the water. Try to swim downhill!
Keep your head low and steady, don’t allow it to swing to the side. Imagine you are an a rotisserie spit that enters through your forehead, your whole body rotates around the centre point. If you raise your head, it’ll cause the rest of your body to sink.
Clench your butt cheeks. (Core muscles are used for position and rotation, doing this helps engage them).
L
egs
In an elite swimmer, the maximum propulsion that comes from kicking is only 15% of overall speed. But to do that requires the body’s largest muscles and disproportionate amount of energy. (Long distance swimmers like myself do very little or no kicking).
Fixing the kick is important for beginners so the legs don’t slow you down or cause you to sink. Kicking wildly (especially common in runners or triathletes) is more likely to cause you to slow. This is also part of the horizontal body position above. From what I have seen most triathlete swim coaches get this completely wrong and spend far too much time focusing on a better kick.
You are not riding a bicycle. Kick from the hips, with only a little movement in the knees. New swimmers often have a big wide kick or their legs sinks, or both. This slows them down.
While reading this, see if you can point your toes like a ballet dancer. If you can’t, start stretching your ankle while watching TV or while sitting at a desk. Not being able to point your toes while swimming is like pulling a weight behind you.
Try swimming with your toes clenched into a fist.
Yes, just like Die Hard
. This will stop you kicking from the knees. You won’t be able to do it all the time, but it will help you understand what your position and kick should feel like.
A
rms
Reach forward. Further still.
Pull back underwater. But only when your palm is facing backwards behind you, not when they are facing the bottom. This called the Catch, when your hand starts effectively pulling.
Keep pulling, then pushing backwards until your thumb scrapes your thigh.
Try to always keep your elbow above your hand, at every point in the stroke. * This is not easy, and take a long time to get right.
B
reathing
Exhale underwater
Hum a little to get used to controlling your breath and exhalation
Try sinking to the bottom of the pool with no arm or leg movement. This will help you learn breath control. Only do this when there is a lifeguard present.
Rotate your head out of the water, don’t lift it. Don’t look forward or around. There is no forward visibility as part of standard front crawl, and learning this is a separate activity.
T
iming
Both arms and legs alternate and all actions are smooth and continuous.
Breathing is to the side.
Rotate your hips to drive your arms to reach forward.
Swimwear
Buy your swim suits one size smaller than the size you think you should wear based on your street clothes because water causes fabric to expand. You can’t see it but others can.
Wear your swimsuit in the shower after your pool swim, it’s easiest way to wash out the chlorinated water. Suits will last up to four times longer. * Polyester suits lasts longer than chlorine tolerant fabric, and feels largely the same.
Swimsuits are currently in a “shrinking phase”, that is, getting smaller. Male briefs are becoming more thong like with very narrow side panels, female racing suits are getting cut much higher at the rear. You can find different cuts, but it can sometimes take a bit of work.
Never wring the water out of your swimsuit, it will weaken the fibres and seriously reduce its longevity. Simply squeeze it or use a suit spinner if there is one available.
Baggy board shorts should not be used. Beginner and many intermediate swimmers have problems with drag. Board shorts add even more drag and make improving your stroke even more difficult.
If you insist on using baggy shorts, please wear something tight underneath, because I have seen too many scrotums and assholes and I’m not even a paid professional.
How you look or feel in a swimsuit does not correlate with how well you swim.
There are three materials for swim caps: cloth, latex and silicone. Cloth is comfortable but otherwise useless, usually used by hotels to keep patrons from getting hair in filters. Latex lasts moderately well but snags hairs more. Silicone which is most expensive lasts longest but is also thickest and may be too warm for some people. No swim cap lasts for ever though. I never get more than a year from a cap.
Swim caps will last longer if your dry them between uses, and better yet sprinkle with talcum powder.
If you have a problem with the swim cap coming off your head while swimming, look for ones which have parallel ridges running around the inside edge.
Pool Hygiene
Pool swimming took a leap forward in the 1960s once reliable swim googles became widely available and training sessions for Olympic swimmers were able to last for 3000 metres or even a whole hour!
Goggles are essential for pool swimming because most pools use chemicals to make the water safe.
I have a longer post explaining the interactions of pool chemicals and people in more detail here
.
Pools that have a strong chlorine or chemical smell are LESS clean than pools that have little or no odour.  The less the chemical smell, the cleaner the pool water.
Pool-water colour has little relationship to pool water quality. Most pools use pool tiles to make the water look blue. Some even add small amounts of copper into the water for the same reason.
Just because you’ve read that swimmers pee in the pool doesn’t mean you have to. But if you do want to stay being a swimmer, you should probably reconcile yourself to the fact that you are absolutely swimming in dilute urine. If this is really troubling you, best of luck with your sex life.
It may not be chlorine that’s making your eyes burn. The pool may have the wrong water acidity (high or low). Soda-ash is added to pool water to control this.
Of course, if there are too many organics (sweat, urine etc) in the pool, then more chlorine must also be added to balance the pool.
Food & drink & peeing
Cold air in the pool deck or changing rooms, cold showers etc, evaporation of water from skin all cause the skin temperature to drop. This raises blood pressure as less blood flows and the hormone that suppresses urination is reduced. All this causes you to need to pee more. It’s completely normal.
Therefore swimmers need to be more careful about hydration. Experienced swimmers will always drink during training.
Yer Mammy was wrong. You can swim after eating.  All marathon distance swimmers like myself have to eat/take nutrition during swims for example. However, your body will be using air to digest food and use energy for exercise at the same time, so you will feel sluggish at best.
Effort & Diet
It is extremely common that new swimmers, regardless of or more likely due to prior experience in other sports, underestimate the overall difficulty of swimming and overestimate how much energy they are expending. If you haven’t mastered breathing and are desperately out of breath this does not mean you expending significant energy.
Calorie consumption rates in swimming given by website, apps or wearable fitness trackers or watches cannot be trusted because the variables are too varied. Weight, water temperature, stroke, experience, rests, set and session duration all play a part. I could say it’s almost certainly less than what any of those are telling you for an hour swimming.
Pools are lower than body temperature and conduct heat away. So your body does start using energy to retain heat. The effect lasts after the swim is over. This makes swimming an appetite enhancer. Swimmers notoriously eat a lot. For beginner swimmers, you need to learn to control this.
Most people with a good but average diet will have sufficient energy in blood and liver stores to sustain two hours of high intensity exercise. So it is not essential to “pre-load” in advance of daily swimming
How much should you swim?
How much you should swim depends obviously on your goals. However since swimming is technically difficult skill, it is safe to say than more swimming is better.
But how much? As a general guideline I recommend four times a week, 2000 metres at a time is a good aim. Beginners won’t be able to swim anywhere near this distance, so let’s say 40 minutes a session.
Injury & other physical problems
“Swimming is low impact sport, with little chance of causing injury“. This is a widely repeated misconception. Apart from the obvious, front crawl injuries to the shoulders do occur, caused by overuse and poor technique. You can get injured with only a small amount of swimming.
The best ways to reduce the risk are to improve your technique and ALWAYS do a little backstroke each session. Backstroke is a stabilising exercise for front crawl. It helps strengthen the opposing muscles in the shoulder muscles to assist in keeping your shoulders balanced. It does not have to be a good technique to be effective.
Does sleeping on your side cause discomfort? The cause is almost certainly tendonitis. This will not get better by itself, or with rest or by reducing swimming. I recommend some deep tissue massage, direct icing and physiotherapy, in that order as required, with massage & ice fixing ninety percent of problems.
Water in your ear is easiest dislodged by bouncing on the heel of the leg on the same side as the water. If this doesn’t work, have a shower and stand with your ear up under the water. If this doesn’t work, try a drop of rubbing alcohol (surgical spirit). Wear ear plugs if this is a repeat problem.
Asthma prevalence is correlated to regular swimming. The simplest and most effective treatment is to use your Daily Preventer, that you may not want to use daily.
Chlorine sensitivity causes very runny nose, sneezing, sore, red or streaming eyes. The simplest and most effective treatment is to use a nose clip. They take about one day to get used to, and are 100% effective.
Okay folks, I'm off to the pool My log resest itself from last year's million metres and I'm once again back to the start.
Second small edit. Doubtless there will be questions. Since I'm in Ireland and I am going swimming, and it'll be llate late after I finish, I'm not going to be able to answer much, sorry. There are more than sufficient swimmers here now to be able to answer most any question.
Remember the best swimmer in the one having the most fun!
(Small edit: I've been asked about my flair here previously. Waay back in the early aeons of
r/fitness
when all the mods were different, the then mods applied flair to some contributors to indicate their expertise in particular areas. I was then the only Channel swimmer here at that time).

Don't Just Do It – A 5 Step Technique to Consistently Get in the Gym
Hey everyone,
The title pretty much says it. For a long time, consistency was the biggest problem I had with my workouts. I struggled because I would go all out for a couple of weeks, then get tired, quit, and have the same body I’d always had.
When I started studying psychology, both in college and on my own time, I realized that I could use what I was learning to help me work out more consistently. Since then, I’ve gained 40 pounds of lean muscle. Of course I eventually learned a lot more about training, but it all started with that consistency.
I wanted to write this guide to help anyone who’s struggling to make exercise a habit. It might also help people who have trouble getting their gym buddies to pony up and tag along.
The guide is split into two parts:
Part one covers the basic psychological tactics that you can use to make exercise a part of your daily routine – without relying on willpower
Part two puts those tactics together into a concrete plan. In 5 steps, you’ll come away knowing exactly how you can achieve your goals.
Part one tactics include chaining (connecting your workouts to other events that you know will happen), precommitments (planning to work out well ahead of when you actually go to the gym), rewards (how to use small, consistent rewards instead of large ones), and barrier reduction (how to get rid of what stops you from working out).
Here's
a quick overview infographic
of the 5 steps in part 2.
In step one, you'll set a specific, actionable goal that lends itself to a clear and specific path of action.
In step two you'll set subgoals, along with times to check in on your progress towards your ultimate destination
In step 3 you'll identify the specific problems that might stop you from achieving your ultimate goal
In step 4 you'll plan ahead, figuring out ways to address your specific roadblocks
Step 5 puts it all together. You'll come away with one piece of paper, your roadmap, that details exactly how you'll reach your destination
I hope you find this helpful!
Psychology has had a huge impact on my life, and I’m happy to answer as many questions as I know the answers to.",
fitness,https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/,6337,1620,A Linear Progression Based PPL Program for Beginners,"To start, a motivational quote:
Errybody wanna be a bodybuilder, but nobody wanna lift this heavy-ass weight.
R. Coleman.
Anyway, there seems to be a bit of a conflict between conventional training wisdom for beginners (3 day a week full body linear progression! SS/SL/Greyskull only!) and what beginners actually wanna do (in the gym every day, biceps and triceps, woo!). What I'm going to write here is an attempt to reconcile these two ideas and produce a sane way for a beginner to train more frequently and give the attention to the glamour muscles that they want, while also progressing in a correct, appropriate manner. To do this, I'm going to borrow wisdom from a few different programs and ideas. My goal is to provide an accessible program for beginners with enough volume to stimulate growth in the bro muscles, while also giving enough intensity in the main movements to elicit strength adaptations.
First, some nomenclature:
3x10 - in this case, it reads
three sets of ten repetitions
2x5, 1x5+  - this reads as,
two sets of 5, one set of at least 5, but as many as possible
(more to come on this later)
SS - this reads as
superset
(two exercises performed back to back with no rest in between.
SUPASET
)
BB -
barbell
DB -
dumbbell
WOAH, WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY ACCESSORY WORK AND MAIN LIFTS?
The main lifts are just the first exercises of the day, and these are always going to be done heavier than the other lifts of that day. The lifts that follow are accessory lifts, designed to build muscle, balance out weakpoints and improve your strength in the main lifts.
BUT I DON'T CARE ABOUT STRENGTH, I JUST WANNA BE JACKED AND TAN
Who doesn't wanna be jacked and tan, I mean honestly? But strength progression is important, especially as a novice, for making you more muscular. Generally speaking, the more you can lift, the bigger you'll be. Progressing your main lifts will also have carryover effects to your other lifts as well: if you can bench press 300lbs, you can sure as hell bet that you're not gonna be incline dumbbell pressing 20lbs. And who do you really think is gonna be bigger: the version of you who can bench 200lbs, or the version of you who can bench 300lbs?
WHAT IS LINEAR PROGRESSION?
Put simply, linear progression means that if you were to graph your weights, the line that you would end up drawing would be straight.
Like this
. This means that you need to add weight workout to workout, every workout. You can make progress very quickly this way
if you're a beginner
because your body doesn't need much stimulus to adapt. As you get more advanced, you need more stimulus and more time to adapt.
See this handy graph from Starting Strength to get a better understanding of what I mean.
WHAT IS PPL?
PPL is just the initialiasm of
push, pull, legs
or
pull, push, legs
(it really doesn't matter which). This will (typically) have you doing 3 workouts, 2 times per week.
Push
- this can just be thought of as moving things
away
from your body (think of a bench press)
Pull
- this can be thought of as moving things
towards
your body (think of a row)
Legs
- I'm not going to bother with an explanation here
WHY DO I NEED TO PROGRESS LIKE THIS?
Because of progressive overload
. Without this, you won't make any adaptations (strength gains or size gains).
You will always start the day with a heavy barbell exercise, and this is what you need to progress linearly (if you remember from above, this means add weight every session). Then afterwards you will follow up with higher repetition exercises, that are more 'bodybuilding' based.
WHAT IS THE PROGRAM?
It's 6 days a week. You can run it one of two ways:
PPLRPPL
or
PPLPPLR
(where R denotes a rest day) depending on your schedule and preferences: it really makes no difference. Personally, I would run the program in the Pull, Push, Legs order.
YOU SAY TO ADD WEIGHT LINEARLY, BUT HOW MUCH WEIGHT DO YOU ADD PER SESSION?
2.5kg/5lbs for upper body lifts (bench press, row, overhead press)
2.5kg/5lbs for squats
5kg/10lbs for deadlifts
Now, without further ado...
PULL
Deadlifts 1x5+/Barbell rows 4x5, 1x5+ (alternate, so if you did deadlifts on Monday, you would do rows on Thursday, and so on)
3x8-12 Pulldowns OR Pullups OR chinups
3x8-12 seated cable rows OR chest supported rows
5x15-20 face pulls
4x8-12 hammer curls
4x8-12 dumbbell curls
PUSH
4x5, 1x5+ bench press/4x5, 1x5+ overhead press (alternate in the same fashion as the rows and deadlifts)
3x8-12 overhead press/3x8-12 bench press (do the opposite movement: if you bench pressed first, overhead press here)
3x8-12 incline dumbbell press
3x8-12 triceps pushdowns SS 3x15-20 lateral raises
3x8-12 overhead triceps extensions SS 3x15-20 lateral raises
LEGS
2x5, 1x5+ squat
3x8-12 Romanian Deadlift
3x8-12 leg press
3x8-12 leg curls
5x8-12 calf raises
FINER DETAILS: AMRAP SETS AND PROGRESSION OF ACCESSORIES
So, the first movements are done for sets of 5, and the final set is what's known as an
AMRAP
set (As Many Reps As Possible). This doesn't mean that you can just YOLO it and push until you can't push anymore. By As Many Reps As Possible, it really means
As many reps as possible while still maintaining good form
. You don't really want to be grinding too many reps, since you want to keep rep quality high. If you want a good reason to keep rep quality high,
watch this recent video from Omar Isuf
. The point of the AMRAP set is that it really gives you a chance to test your limits, and if you're feeling good on a specific day, you can get in a couple of extra reps. But the real moneymaker from this comes in when you deload.
Progression of accessories
should be done as so: when you can hit 3 sets of 12 with good form, add weight. As long as you're in the 8-12 range for your sets then you're good. If not, lower the weight.
HOW DO I KNOW WHAT WEIGHTS TO START WITH?
I don't like the Stronglifts 5x5 idea of starting with the empty bar, because I think the empty bar is useless for training purposes if you're capable of lifting a lot more. The mechanics of a lift (especially the squat for me) change a lot with weight.
I would recommend starting with the bar, and gradually adding weight for sets of 5 until the bar slows down. Then back off 2.5kg/5lbs, and this is your starting point. So if you worked up to a 60kg bench press before the bar slowed down at all, start at 57.5kg.
WARMUPS
(idea courtesy of
/u/Gawd1
)
I'm a big believer in just practising the movement as a warmup. So you can use bench press to warm up for bench press. Or squats to warm up for squats. You get the idea. The goal of a warmup is to get blood into the muscles and joints that are going to be used, and also to start drilling the motor patterns into your body for form purposes. As an example, if you're going to be benching 200lbs as your top set for that day, your warmups could look something like this:
Empty bar x 10
95lbs x10
135lbs x5
185lbs x3
200lbs 4x5, 1x5+
Warming up is a very individual thing, however, so do whatever you want to get yourself prepared for the lifts. If you like foam rolling, great. If you like some dynamic stretches and things like clapping pushups, great. Do whatever you want to do. The only recommendation is that I would avoid static stretches before lifting.
REST
Rest as long as is needed between sets. For a general guideline, I would recommend:
3-5 minutes between your first exercise of the day
1-3 minutes between all your other exercises
Don't worry too much about rest times, and worry more about just getting all your sets and reps in.
FAILURE
Failure is part of life, and since lifting weights is a lot like life, failure is also part of lifting weights. At some point, you're going to fail. Failure can occur really for two reasons
not enough sleep, food or recovery: if you spent all night partying and chasing pussy with your wing man, Jim Beam, you're probably not gonna perform well in the gym. In this case, don't count it as a true failure and just try again next time when you're fresh
strength failure. This is when you've reached the limit of your progression. If you fail a session 3 times in a row (for example, if you fail to hit 3x5 on squats at 100kg 3 times in a row), you need to lower the weight.
This leads us to...
DELOADING
Deloading is exactly what it sounds like -- taking weight off the bar. Take 10% off your working weights (so a 100kg squat would go back down to 90kg), and work back up. This should give you a good chance to push things on the AMRAP final sets. If you got 2x5 and 1x6 at 90kg the first time round, you can bet your ass that you'll get more than 6 on your last set the second time round. And by the time you work your way back up, if you can hit 97.5kg for 2x5, 1x8, 100kg for 3x5 will be trivial.
MY GYM OR GARAGE DOESN'T HAVE XYZ, WHAT CAN I DO INSTEAD?
(this section as recommended by
/u/LaRivalita
)
So basically everything here is interchangeable, except the main lifts: the squat, bench press, deadlift, overhead press, bent over row. If you can do those in your gym (not in a smith machine) then you can make this program work. Treat it more as template than gospel. Some ideas for substitutions are the following (and if anyone has other suggestions, I'm happy to add them to the list!):
Pull substitutions
Seated cable rows can be replaced with dumbbell rows or t-bar rows
Face pulls can be replaced with rear delt flyes AND band pull aparts (not one or the other)
hammer curls and dumbbell curls can really be replaced by any curl variation: it's a curl, shit ain't that serious!
Push substitutions
incline dumbbell press can be replaced with landmine press
triceps pushdowns and overhead extensions can be replaced with any general triceps exercise: skullcrushers, lying triceps extensions, dumbbell triceps extensions, whatever you want to do
Legs substitutions
Leg press can be substituted with front squats
leg curls can be substituted with glute ham raises
calf raises can be substituted by nothing because who gives a flying fuck about calves anyway? (not srs, any kind of calf raise will be fine here)
HOW TO MODIFY THIS TO FIT YOUR GOALS
(this section as recommended by
/u/theedoor
)
If you want to lift heavy weights
There are a few things I would recommend here.
/u/theedoor
's advice of: ""for example, if you want to be focused a bit more on strength, replace 3x8-12 RDLs with 3x5 RDLs. Add weighted dips, and weighted chins-ups/pull-ups in the 3x5 range (with bodyweight back off sets)."" is brilliant.
If you want to lift heavy weights, then you need to lift heavy weights. I know this sounds stupid, but it makes sense. The more time you spend in the lower rep ranges, the better you're going to be in those rep ranges, so if you want to lift heavy weights then feel free to alter the compound movement accessories (so your presses, your pulldowns or rows, your romanian deadlifts or your leg presses) to be in the lower rep ranges. 3x4-6 is perfect for things like this. In my view, the isolation accessory movements should be kept in higher rep ranges, because joint wear and tear can creep in here, and getting a pump is fucking awesome.
Specificity is also pretty key if you want to lift heavy weights. If you want to be a good bench presser, then maybe incline dumbbell press isn't going to be
as specific
as doing a close grip bench press instead is. If you want to substitute some of the (again, compound) accessory movements for ones that more closely resemble the main lifts, then be my guest.
If you want to increase endurance
Keep the first exercise the same, up the rep range on everything else. 15-20 reps is a great range for increasing endurance.
If you just want to be jacked and tan
Keep things the way they are. There's enough volume and a decent enough mix of volume and strength to get you big as long as you're eating enough. If you feel a specific bodypart is lacking, throw in a couple of extra sets for it, ideally isolation (so think along the lines of pec deck or biceps curls, not bench press or rows), so that you're not adding too much systemic stress, which could affect recovery times.
WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT, FORM OR WEIGHT?
(idea courtesy of
/u/Nobody773
)
Both. Nobody got big benching 1 plate regardless of how good their form is. You should push the weights up and continue progressing as long as your form is
acceptable.
Demanding that your form is 100% perfect all the time as a beginner is just not possible, so as long as your form is acceptable and not injurious, then continue adding weight. As an unknown lifter once said: the best way to improve your form at 225lbs is to make 225lbs part of your warmup. I can guarantee that when you're squatting 315lbs for reps that your form at 225lbs is picture perfect.
THIS IS COMPLICATED, THERE'S A LOT GOING ON! HOW DO I KEEP TRACK OF THIS?
It's something I hadn't thought of, since I have a borderline-autistic savant memory for things I do in the gym, but
here is spreadsheet created by /u/Mobius000
which will make tracking this a walk in the park.
CAN I DO THIS PROGRAM WHILE CUTTING?
Sure! You can do anything while cutting, so try it out. I suspect that recovery may become an issue due to the volume, so if you are struggling to recover and feeling like shit, drop some of the volume: 3x8-12 becomes 2x8-12, for example. Taper the volume off as little as possible, and keep the volume for the main lifts as high as you can for as long as you can.
CAN I DO AB WORK ON THIS PROGRAM?
Yes. I would recommend doing ab work on your deadlift days and your squat days if you want to do ab work. Nothing major, just do a few sets of (weighted) planks or a few sets of ab wheel and some hanging leg raises.
NEXT STEPS
A few people have requested this, so I thought I would write out what I think logical next steps from here are. This is a
beginner
routine, for beginners. Intermediate and advanced lifters can't make linear progress like this anymore, and require some more advanced training in order to progress.
Questions courtesy of
/u/FattestRabbit
:
What are some signs that you may want to graduate from this program?
Put simply, when you're no longer a beginner. A beginner lifter is defined as someone who can make progress workout to workout: if you deadlift 100kg for 5 reps, then the next time you deadlift you'll be able to deadlift 105kg for 5 reps. Once this
linear
progression stalls out, and you take longer to recover between workouts because the weights are heavier (and therefore the systemic stress is higher), you become an intermediate lifter. An intermediate lifter is someone who needs ~weekly progression in order to maintain progress (programs like the Texas Method for example).
Can you adapt this program for 'intermediate' lifters? How far can this program take you if you upped the weights and moved more sets to 3x5-8 (instead of 3x8-12)?
Yes, you can adapt this program for more intermediate lifters, but I wouldn't like to try and formalise something like that. The more advanced you get as a lifter, the more you should be realising what things are beneficial for you, and figuring out what works for you, because everyone is a bit different. In the beginner stages, this stuff really isn't too important because almost any beginner will make progress doing almost anything. I would recommend looking at progression schemes that are in things like the
Texas Method
,
Madcows 5x5
and
5/3/1
for your main lifts and then just sticking with fairly similar accessory work: more volume almost always equates to better gains, provided you can recover from it.
Moving more sets to 3x5-8 wouldn't necessarily have a huge impact on your abilities to lift big weights in the main lifts, and heavier sets (in my experience) tend to impose more wear and tear on the joints. If you're an intermediate lifter then go for it, try it out, it may work for you. Intermediate lifting should be all about trying things for yourself and getting to know yourself better as a lifter.
What are some next logical programs to try after this one?
Texas Method, Madcows 5x5, 5/3/1, PHAT, PHUL,
/u/gzcl
's Jacked and Tan - any program designed towards intermediates that are in line with your goals. Pick something you think you'll have fun with: unless this shit is your job or you really want to compete seriously then just have fun in the gym and don't do something too retarded, and you'll probably stick to it better than something you hate, and go to the gym with more drive and intensity. I'm a big believer that consistent effort is probably the most important thing you can make sure of.
PowerliftingToWin
is a great resource for training information and programming information, so I would recommend reading a bunch there.
CAN I DO THIS ROUTINE ONLY ONCE PER WEEK?
You
could.
And that's all I'm gonna say. I wouldn't recommend it, because that'd put frequency of all the lifts at only once per week. If you can only run it once per week then I would recommend something like Greyskull LP, Stronglifts 5x5 or Starting Strength instead for increased frequency.",

Stats:
45, 5'5"", 120lbs (I was born into extreme poverty and malnourished as a child, which stunted my growth)
Goal:
To stay healthy, fit, and active for as long as possible, while avoiding injuries and minimizing impact/stress to joints.
Diet:
Primarily plant based (with lots of beans for protein!), and occasional fish/seafood (2-4 times/month). No meat otherwise, and no dairy (except for the rare ice cream treat; a pint can last months in my freezer). I've been doing 16:8 intermittent fasting for many years now, and am thoroughly loving it (it's not for everyone, so always check with a medical professional before you make any significant changes to your lifestyle).
Supplements:
None, except for daily calcium & Omega 3 pills.
Sleep:
6 hours a day, plus post-work naps as needed.
Misc:
Never drank, smoked, or used drugs. Don't like coffee/tea. I do enjoy the occasional smoothie, but otherwise primarily drink water.
Workout routine:
Monday/Wednesday/Friday - 50 min cardio (10K run on elliptical using HIIT program, getting my peak heart rate into the 170s)
Tuesday - arms/back/abs (3 sets of ~15 reps each)
Arms:
* barbell curl
* one arm cable curls
* reverse curl
* chin-ups

Back:
* lat pulldown
* back extension machine
* pull ups
* vertical row

Abs:
* hanging leg raises
* ab crunches
* decline crunches
Thursday - legs/abs (3 sets of ~15 reps each)
Legs:
* quad extension
* hamstring curls
* leg press machine
* calf machines (standing & seated)
Saturday - chest/triceps/abs (3 sets of ~15 reps each)
Chest:
* flat bench press
* incline bench press
* decline bench press
* chest fly machine
* dips

Notes: I don't use heavy weights in my bench presses since I'm not a powerlifter and I don't have a workout partner to spot me, so I've incorporated more exercises to compensate.

Triceps:
* triceps pushdown
* dumbell kickback
* overhead triceps extension
Other thoughts:
Still feeling great at 45, and am proud to have successfully maintained a 28"" waist size since my 20s despite working a full time desk job. I try to view food as fuel for my body rather than a treat for my taste buds, and I only eat when I feel hungry (I'm too lazy to count calories). I don't skip workouts unless I'm injured/sick/contagious.
Consistency
is key, but listen closely to your body, and go light on weights or take a break from a certain exercise if needed. Be sure to watch that form! Also, take good care of your teeth! I'm lucky to still have all mine, and I brush/floss/waterpik every day, plus I never skip a dentist visit.
Try to minimize stress in your life by being financially responsible and living below your means, and seek help for issues that you have trouble dealing with on your own. Simplify, simplify, simplify! Remove toxic people and non-value added activities from your life, and focus your energy on the things in your
circle of control
. You will be much healthier and happier!
Edit: Wow, this blew up. I forgot to mention, stretching is extremely important to me! I always stretch prior to working out, and I feel it has been beneficial to me so far. Also, this is just what has personally worked for me. I'm not a definitive authority on health and fitness, I just wanted to share my story. You should find what works for you, and stick with it.

But I know not everyone wants to watch a 6-minute video, although I tried to make it concise, so I made looping GIF's with my doggie to help save redditors precious time.
Lacrosse Ball GIFs
Gluteus Maximus
Piriformis
Hamstrings
(sit on hard surface and place under thigh)
Feet / Plantar Fascia
(hold onto something for balance)
Upper Back (Traps)
Triceps/Brachialis
Triceps alternative style
(tack ball and straighten/bend elbow)
Gluteus Medius
(Static, just chill over it)
Deltoids & Upper Chest against wall (no GIF of this, it's in the video tho and it's worth mentioning that you could do it)
Lacrosse Ball Alternatives
If you don't have a lacrosse ball, you could use a tennis ball, baseball, softball, billiard ball, cricket ball, floor hockey ball, golf ball, spalding bouncey ball as alternatives. They don't work as well as the lacrosse one in some cases, but it's better than nothing and sometimes it may even be better!
Foam roller?
About a year ago I made a similar post showing
how I use a foam roller
with a video+GIFs to tackle very large areas of the body. A foam roller in combination with a lacrosse ball, is my peanut butter and jelly.
Edit:
Epiccc # of upvotes. Thanks guys.  I knew when I made the gifs, it looked a bit crazy with me staring at the camera... but... I was like, whatever, it is what it is I guess. I enjoyed making them though. The way I go about making them is by clipping a tiny section of me going from one direction to the other, putting it into photoshop (file-import video frames to layers), then from the animation tool bar, find the arrow to select all layers, then paste layers after last frame, then reverse pasted layers (this is in animation toolbar), delete middle frame and last frame cause those are redundant, and then export as video, upload to gfycat, rinse repeat. Oh and I use gfycat cause they were the first service that supported html5. (Imgur copied them long after.)",

TL;DR
Decided to get healthy, and in shape before I turned 30 years old, and did something about it. Lifted weights, counted my calories, and worked hard. No special diet program, just simple stuff that almost anyone can do.
Summary
A little over 9 months ago I looked at myself in the mirror (literally, and figuratively), and I didn't like what I saw. I was a 29 year old, very overweight, lacking motivation, and confidence. My energy levels were low, and I knew it was effecting my family (wife and kids). I was tired of it, and wanted to finally do something about it.
Phase 1: Lose Fat ASAP
March 2015 – June 2015 (3 months)
Eat Healthier, smaller portions
– I knew I was super over weight, so I needed to lose fat. I used
LoseIt App
, and counted everything that went into my mouth. I calculated my TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) using online calculators, and adjusted my calories about every 2 weeks.
Lift Weights
– I started lifting weights with a friend of mine who had already been lifting for a few years. He taught me the ropes, and helped introduce me to some starter routines. During Phase 1, I did a basic Push, Pull, Legs (PPL) routine. I split this between 4 days per week (M, T, R, F).
Light Cardio
– I did about 15 minutes of cardio 2-3 times per week after lifting weights, just for some cardiovascular health, and to help with the weight loss.
Macronutrients
– I aimed for about 200g Protein daily, and then didn't really count my carbs or fat.
Calories
– I ate anywhere between 1800-2000 calories a day.
Example Daily Meals
Meal #1, 4 egg whites, 2 eggs, cereal
Meal #2, 6oz. Chicken, sweet potato, veggies
Meal #3, Preworkout: Protein Bar
Meal #4, 8oz Protein, carbs, and veggies
Cheat Meal
– Every 7-10 days, I'd have a cheat meal. Note: NOT A CHEAT DAY. Just a meal. This meal I would eat whatever I wanted, as much as I wanted. Usually it'd be a couple greasy burgers, chinese, or a pizza. These meals gave me a little something to look forward too, and also helped push off my weekly cravings.
Favorite Meal
:
Qdoba
. You can get a LOT of protein packed into very little calories, if you order right. I love Qdoba.
Ending Weight
: 198 lbs.
Phase 2: Gain Muscle
June 2015 – October 2015 (3 months)
Eat a lot
– I like to eat, so this phase was much easier for me. I actually probably gained too much weight, too quickly, and I will be changing that in my future ""bulk"" phases.
Calories
– I aimed for about 3300-3500 calories per day.
Example Daily Meals
Meal #1, Lots of eggs (8-10), protein shake, and cereal
Meal #2, 8oz. Chicken, sweet potato, veggies
Meal #3, 8oz. Beef w/ noodles
Meal #4, Protein bar, PB&J Sandwich
Meal #5, 8oz Protein, carbs, and veggies
Meal #6, Before bed: Yogurt, or cottage cheese
Macronutrients
– My goal was about 220g-250g Protein per day, and filled the rest of my calories with carbs and fats.
Weight Training
– Because I had so much more energy, I added in another day in the gym. So I began going 5 days per week. I gained a lot of strength during this phase too, which I attributed to the amount of calories I was consuming, and better form/technique that I had been developing with the help of my friend.
Challenges
– People talk about dirty bulks vs. clean bulks. Dirty bulking is obviously easier, and much more enjoyable. You basically eat everything you see, without regard for anything. I probably fell somewhere in between dirty and clean. I think it's good to find a balance, because if you do it too dirty you'll end up gaining quite a bit of fat. Like I did.
Cardio
– None.
Favorite Meal
: Donuts for breakfast, and Burgers for lunch. Ya, not healthy at all, I didn't eat this every day.
Ending weight
: 232 lbs
Phase 3: Cut the weight, reveal gains
October 2015 – December 2015 (3 months)
Calories
– Basically went back to what I was eating in Phase 1. 1800-2000 calories per day. With a cheat meal every 7-10 days.
Trying to keep strength
– I really feel I have my routine, and form dialed in right now with my weight training. Currently I'm doing a split that is kind of a mixture of a PPL, and ""Bro-split"". I really like it, and I feel exhausted after every workout, which is good.
Cardio
– I try to do cardio once per week, but honestly I often skip it. I'm really trying to get more consistent, because I know that it's good for my cardiovascular health. But it just hasn't been top priority for me.
Current Weight
: 200 lbs.
Weight left to lose
: ~15 lbs.
What Motivated me?
Honestly my biggest motivation came from wanting to prove myself wrong. All my life, I've just accepted that I was overweight, and that it was pointless to try and do anything about it. I ate food for comfort, and when I was stressed. Every time I went to buy clothes, I dreaded it, because I knew nothing would fit ""just right"". I hated looking at myself in pictures, and always secretly felt embarrassed.
I wanted to prove to myself that I could do it, and that
it doesn't have to be complicated
.
So what's next?
Enjoy life more with my family, friends. Get out and do things that I could/wouldn't do previously. I just want to be the best I can for them.
Take my shirt off this summer, and feel confident!
Keep losing weight! I'm wanting to diet down to about 10% bodyfat, and then start another bulk phase. This time, doing it more clean!
After this time I've spent working on my diet and training, I've really gotten into bodybuilding, and I considering trying to compete in the future. I know I'm still a long ways away, and I'm pretty old to begin competing, but I don't care. I just want to give myself a new challenge.
Biggest thing I learned?
Failing is ok
– I had many days where I felt I had ""failed"". But I had to keep reminding myself why I was doing what I was doing. So the next day, I would just start over, with a clean plate, and get back on track. I had to remember that it was a ""marathon"", not a ""sprint"". Failing is ok, just get back up the next day, and move forward.
It doesn't have to be complicated or expensive
– Honestly the biggest thing I learned is that getting in shape isn't rocket science. No matter what anyone tells you. All these instagram fitness coaches, supplement businesses, and ""weight-loss magic"" sellers, are just trying to make money. Some of their products might assist, but none of them are a replacement for hardwork in the gym, determination/commitment, and a balanced diet. I didn't follow any ""special program"". I just stopped stuffing my face with food all the time, and starting going to the gym a few times per week.
Final thought.
Was it difficult? Yes, many days were struggles to go back to the ""old me"". Would I go back to how I was before? No way in hell.
For those interested, here is a simple breakdown of my current weight lifting program. I do this 6 days/week, Monday-Saturday.
Day 1: Chest, Quads
Day 2: Back, Hams, Glutes
Day 3: Shoulders, Arms

Edit 2: A couple more tips
Weigh yourself everyday!
A lot of people say not to do this, but I'm a firm believer in doing it. I believe it helps you get more familiar with your body, and how it works. You see, and understand the fluctuations in your weight throughout the week. If you only weigh yourself once a week, you could be weighing yourself when you're retaining a lot of water, or not retaining. And you could get discouraged if you are up a pound or 2 after a week of eating well. If you weigh yourself DAILY, then you see these fluctuations constantly. (e.g. of how my weight would fluctuate. I weighed almost every day for the last 9 months.)
Take at least 2 photos a week
, to track your progress. I can't emphasize this enough! The scale isn't always the best way to track your progress, as you can see from my progress pics. I weighed almost the same in my before, and after phase 2 pics, but my body composition was much different. If I had only relied on a scale, I could have been discouraged by this. But I had plenty of pics to look back and see.",

Before and after:
https://imgur.com/gallery/A3hwN
I grew up being a fat kid my whole life. Up until I was about 18. I tried to avoid any kind of physical activities since I wasn't good at any sports nor interested.
Right before I finished high school, one of my friends asked me if I wanted to go to a gym with him and I just went without knowing what to expect. My first day at the gym was horrible. I remember using two 35lbs dumbbells to do a flat bench dumbbell press and thinking I was going to pass out after the 3rd rep. Since then, I've always been in and out of the gym. I did the typical bro split (chest/tris, back/bis, and etc). I didn't know what I was doing but since I was somewhat consistent, I didn't look ""fat"" anymore. Fast forward to summer of 2014, my clinical depression (got diagnosed way back in the day so I've had it pretty much my whole life) hit me harder than usual and I just dropped everything. I flunked all my classes, ate whatever &amp;amp;amp;amp;whenever and  slept when I wasn't eating. Fast forward to December 2014, I went to my mom's house for Christmas dinner and decided to weigh myself to find out that I gained 35lbs in span of 5 months(and I wasn't working out at all during that time so I'm assuming it was 35lbs + how much ever muscle mass I lost).
I decided that enough was enough and started dieting again on New Years. For diet, I carb cycles which worked really well with my carb cravings and 3 day split that I was running. I didn't really count my calories since I was tracking my macros instead but it usually went like this.
My macros were:
Day1(rest) 50c/30f/200p (1250-1300kcal)
Day2(push) 150c/30f/200p (1800-1950kcal)
Day3(pull) 150c/30f/200p (1800-1950 kcal)
Day4(legs) 300c/60f/200p (2200kcal)
Every 8th day of my high carb day, I had a ""cheat meal"" but tried to stay on healthier side instead of binging on calorie condensed food (deep fried, sweets, and etc. but I did treat myself to milkshakes from time to time). I didn't really do any cardio during my cut just because I was lazy.
Routine:
https://www.jefit.com/routines/workout-routine-database.php?id=22104
I ran this for a while but also took time away from dieting when I was on vacation and enjoying summer. From fall of 2015 until August of 2016, I fluctuated back and forth between 185-195. In September, I was sitting at 185, not happy with how much mass I had I decided to ""mini-bulk"" up to 195 before cutting again. I'm not sure if that bulk did much at all but I started my cut again in October same carb cycling but upping my fat to 60 per day while dropping my protein according to my body weight.
Routine now:
https://bodymaxing.com/2016/09/15/dltbb-routine/
I'm sitting at 179-180lbs right now hoping to cut maybe 5lbs before I reverse diet or maintain. But I'm pretty happy with my result so far. It took me longer than some people's transformation, but I enjoyed myself when I wanted to and made it work with on my own time. Someone once told me, ""your fitness journey is not a sprint, but a marathon. So as long as you stay consistent and never give up. You'll get to your destination."" And it really helped me out a lot when I was in doubt or feeling down with how I looked.
Thank you for reading and again, sorry about the format and grammar.
Edit: whoa, thank you all for compliments, advices and just responding in general. I didn't expect this post to blow up!
Yes, my mirror is dirty... I do clean it often, but when I wash my face, I splash water everywhere... I'll clean it more often 😭😭.
My hair looks horrible in my before pics because they were all pre shower hair + bed hair. I have the same haircut I just style it different depending on how long it gets. Here are some pics if you are interested.

A little backstory.
It all started a few years ago when I went to the bowling alley with a group of friends and I was unable to curl the 8lb ball. Pretty big eye opener that made me want to hit the gym. I thought at first it would be nearly impossible, but my buddies gave me a hand and were my gym partners from that day on. My goal weight is 155 pounds and hopefully someday I'll reach that goal. Regardless I am pretty content with this transformation.
Edit 1
: I see that I must provide more information to how I achieved this transformation. I will provide one soon.
Edit 2
: Sorry work got a little busy, anyways.
First and foremost I ordered this
weight gainer
to help me gain some mass. To my embarrassment, yes the picture on the left was weighing at approximately 100 lbs. That was during the time I just ate once or twice a day. I changed that eating lifestyle to eating at least 4 time a day with two protein shakes, one in the morning and one before bed. I also took some preworkout (Jack3d, C4) to give me that boost of energy necessary to rep some weights.
As far as for workouts and reps, my buddies were my trainers. So I will try my best as to what exactly they made me do each day. I found this on my notes on my phone.

I got rejected by a very cute girl on March 10, 2016. Later that night, as I lay on my bed covered in a greasy sauce from the pound of Buffalo Chicken Cheese Fries I had just devoured, I took one last sip of my Green Tea Arizona and decided it was time for a change. I climbed down from my bunk bed and had my roommate take pictures of my sulking ass. The rest is history. 
When I posted that progress picture to instagram, I got a flood of questions from my friends asking how they can do the same. Instead of answering the same question 100 times, I made a google drive folder with all the info they'd ever need:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Y8MmU9NVxdFgeKU5cB-oM8TVUgnESCh4
PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE MY POST FOR LACK OF INFORMATION, THE DRIVE HAS IT ALL
This includes my
diet plan, my routines
, and a quick rundown of my 2 year journey and what I learned about bodybuilding. Take note, I'm a very straightforward, no bs type of guy, so what I wrote in that 13 page manuscript is a hard, honest opinion on what I believe is necessary to seriously pursue bodybuilding. If you want to know how to truly start bodybuilding without wasting time sifting through Bro-Science, it's all in my ""How To Get Swole"" document. I also have a potty mouth, but that's something you're gonna have to deal with.
With that being said: I was 18 years old and started at 121 lbs, 19% body fat. I only gained about 20lbs of lean body mass, which goes to show how much of a trial-and-error process this has been. I was in a weird grey area of body composition, being skinny fat. I was weak and fat, so I didn't know whether to bulk or cut first. I tried cutting first and that was a huge mistake. I then decided to bulk and focus on strength gains, and everything took off from there.
I started with Strong Lifts, going from benching the bar for 5x5 to benching a plate for 5x5. I did this for about a year until I could squat and deadlift 2 plates for 5x5.
My second year of training, I started incorporating accessory lifts. I made a Push Pull Leg style routine, putting shoulders on my leg day due to excessive fatigue on my push days. I did 2 days on one day off. I made the mistake of dirty bulking my first year, so I decided to start cutting. I counted calories and macros, and got to about 13% body fat before I gave up and blew right back up to 16%. I finally decided to start a serious cut, getting down to about 11% which took 5 months of strict dieting.
Now that I'm as lean as I've ever been, I plan on starting my very first lean bulk in preparation for my first bodybuilding competition. I have about a year and a half to train, so I plan to bulk until January 3rd, allowing myself about 16 weeks to cut before my show. I'm going to focus entirely on hypertrophy training. The routine is in the drive folder I posted earlier.",

​
Howdy
/r/fitness
!
I wanted to give you all an update on my journey to sobriety and wellness. It's 6 months in, and I am very proud to report that I'm still alcohol-free and still hitting the gym.
​
Here are my 6 month before/after photos (Kinda NSFW I suppose)
https://imgur.com/a/poInCR9
Height: 5 ft 5 inches
Age: 28
Pounds lost: 30 (165-135)
Bodyfat: 11.5%
​
Exercise Routine
Not long after my original post, I maxed out my small gym's dumbbells (they went to a max of 50 pounds), so I switched to a new routine that places major emphasis on bodyweight and HIIT training:
Workout A:
Dips, Pike Pushups, Push Ups, Step Ups, Pistol Squats, Dragon Flags, Suspension Tricep Extensions
Workout B:
Pull-ups, Suspension Rows, Suspension Curls, Suspension delt flies, Active hangs, Planks, Dumbbell Deadlifts
I run this routine twice/week, with a rest day in the middle: A, B, rest, A, B, rest, rest. I do workout on an empty stomach though, as I believe (with absolutely no data to back it up lol) that it helps with burning fat off.
All exercises are 4 sets of 20 (except for the Dragon Flag - if I can get 3 sets of 2 or 3, I'm thrilled haha). For some of them, such as pull-ups, I'll try my best to get 20, but usually, fall short. I try to keep my heart rate up, so I usually power through the workout in 30 minutes or less. I recently bought a 40 lb weighted vest though, so that's causing me to do less reps (10)
​
Diet:
My diet hasn't changed much, but on the recommendation of many Redditors, I stopped with the Lean Cuisine and started meal prepping fresh meals.
Goal caloric intake – 1,800 cals/day, but I usually get around 1,400 to 1,600.
Macro goals – 150+g protein, under 160g carbs, under 60g fat.
Breakfast – Breakfast shake (Greek yogurt, protein powder, bananas, fresh fruits, almond milk, and flax seed)
Lunch – One chicken breast with 1 cup cooked brown rice
Snacks – Optimum Nutrition Whey Protein (2 scoops), Apples, Oranges, Pears, etc
Dinner – Flexible, just as long as it fits my macros (Usually a home cooked meal though, my favorites are Pork Tenderloin or Shrimp Stir Fry)
Pre-bed snack – Carrots, Celery, or the occasional can of Tuna (although once in a while I cheat and have ice cream or of chips...gotta cheat once in a while to remain sane!)
Supplements:
Protein – Optimum Nutrition Whey Vanilla Ice Cream (2 scoops) daily
Creatine – Six Star 100% Creatine Monohydrate (5g) daily
Multivitamin – CVS brand One-a-Day Men’s Health Multivitamin (1 pill) daily
PreWorkout – Six Star Explosion Ripped (1 scoop) only on lifting days
​
As a side note - you all have been a huge help in my reaching my goals. The level of motivation and knowledge that I gain here is amazing. Thank you all for making my ongoing transformation possible.",

Here is my summary to meet Rule 2 of
r/Fitness
:
TL;DR/Top Ten Changes I've Personally Made From These Lessons:
There's a million bits of info in these notes, but here's some ten takeaways I was able to implement over the course of two months.
Carbs:
Carbs are not the enemy, but need to be heavily regulated and based on individual performance, digestive health, and body-fat. Ethnic background is a huge factor. That being said, Charles states ""you need to earn your carbs,"" while Stan is more lenient, but still recommends you keep them low if you're not an elite athlete. If you do choose to eat carbs, white rice is the best carb as it doesn't cause inflammation or digestive issues like potatoes and brown rice can.
Sleep:
The greatest anabolic, absolutely necessary. The elite performers sleep 10-12 hours a day, including long naps during the day. Important to muscle growth, fat loss, and hormone regulation. I dim the lights 2 hours before bed, do my best to not check my phone, tv, or any electronic screen to improve sleep quality.
Programming:
I've split my workouts with 72-hours between muscle groups. Using a variety of exercises helps overall performance by choosing accessory work that addresses weaknesses. ""Exercise rotation and having a big exercise library prevents injury while allowing constant key movements."" Only 4 main heavy days, with the other days as options for accessory or cardio.
Food choice:
Grass-fed meat research isn't proven yet, and doesn't justify the price. Eat quality cuts of beef, bison, and wild game. ""Otherwise, the best diet is the one you stick to."" Just eliminated processed foods and snacks, and choose vegetables and fruits that the body will digest easily (
FodMap
). Bought a sous-vide to prepare the Costco Steak, and a rice maker for the white rice. On it for two months and am seeing great results. Personally, I've added lots of berries, avocadoes, baby carrots, nuts, coconut oil, chia seeds to my daily diet. I also add kimchi and guacamole to some meals in order to keep the steak from being too routine. Also drinking 3oz of OJ multiple times a day.
Warm-Up:
Stretching is apparently a waste of time, and cardio before your lift will cause you to be insulin resistant, preventing fat loss. Either do potentiation exercises, or follow this advice: ""brain should know the range of motion, and weights should get heavier."" Regarding potentiation: find where the weakest links are in the main lift, then pick a moderately light weight, and choose exercises that affect different muscle groups involved in the main lift. For example, the squat might be upper back (a), lower back (b), then hamstrings (c). Doesn't need to be heavy, just consistently volume with minimal rest. 4x25 with no rest: a, b,c, repeat 4 times total. Then rest 3-5 minutes, then you're ready attack the main lift (be if your heavy max or speed work). Matt noticed clients were getting stronger, and form was getting better over time. Matt started off light, but now can do 4x25's of 100lb dumbells on chest warmups. Work your way up.
Walking:
Not just for old people: Ten minute walk, after you eat a meal. Improves digestion, decreases DOMS, helps with insulin sensitivity. ""Blood is the life force, brings in all the nutrients."" Brisk walks with elevated heart outperforms leisure 10k step-walks in fat, heart, cardio benefits. Recommended is 3 ten-minute walks a day. Can replace all steady-state cardio with walks and HIIT. Recommended them to the women in competition and strongmen like the Mountain, both of whom saw fantastic results.
Cardio:
Implemented rucks over distance running, along with adding swimming, cycling, and farmers carries. Long slow-distance work inhibits muscle growth
and
fat-loss. That said, some cardio is required, hence the HIIT, farmers walks, etc as they are recommended. Still learning to program into the workout regimen.
Build the Backside:
If the muscle is behind you, chances are you need to build it stronger. The average person will have weak lower and upper back, hamstrings, glutes, calves, traps, rear delts, etc. Build those up by making them a priority in your accessory exercise selection. For example: Upperback not strong enough will change scapular position on bench press.
Salt:
Upped the intake of my salt. Iodized salt, stimulates thyroid, immune system, stimulates the liver. When you hit a wall, it's because you're low on sodium, not carbs. Guaranteed. Single biggest thing you can do to impact performance, stamina and endurance at the gym is iodized sodium.
Post-workout drink:
Body super-compensates after a workout, so you need immediate replenishment, especially for two-a-days. Fructose (Orange juice) for liver stimulation, dextrose (scoop off Amazon) for glycogen replenishment, sodium (600mg), 100mg of caffeine (accelerates all of that). No proteins or fats immediately as it slows absorption.",

TL;DR Was fat, am not anymore.
https://i.imgur.com/rBVgYk9.jpg
Just wanted to talk to you a bit about my transformation in the last 2 years. It was a hell of a rollercoaster.
In May 2015, I had enough. I was feeling sick, I was 24 and supposed to be in my prime. But at 340 pounds and 5’11’’, it was not the case.
So I decided to change. I went on the subreddit
r/loseit
and learned how to lose weight by counting your calories.
And it worked.
In the first week I lost 17 pounds. Sure, a lot of it was water but God did it give me motivation to continue. The second week, I was 10 pounds lighter. It really worked.
So I counted my calories until I was around 215 pounds. By then, I had lost 125 pounds in around 7 months.
While I was doing this, I decided to do the C25K (
r/C25K
) to help me start running. I ran my first 5K while I was weighing 275 pounds. It was slow, so very slow, but I did it. I was SO proud of myself. I was working on becoming a healthier person.
That’s when I saw one of my childhood friend who is a gym rat. He was so proud of me and asked me if I was going to the gym. I was, but I did not follow any program. I was still doing some “FuckArountIt”, meaning I didn’t know what I was doing. So he helped me to do a basic program.

With this new program in the gym, I then started to follow something like LeanGains (
r/leangains
) in counting my macros.
Training days 1800 Calories High Protein, High Carbs, Low Fat.
Rest Day 1500 Calories High Protein, Low Carbs High Fat.
And I continued to shed some fat. It was slower, of course but progress kept on going. I stopped after 11 months at 172 pounds lost. I was weighing 168 pounds and was pretty skinny.
https://i.imgur.com/c4BEQyK.jpg
At this point, I started going to maintenance a bit, around 2200/2400 calories. It was summer so I went in vacation, had fun and enjoyed my new shape. I even did a 21k for fun with a friend.
So, here we are. 168 pounds, able to run 21k, going to the gym 3 to 4 time a week. Eating 2200 calories a day. What was I going to do now?
It’s Bulk time. To do this, I changed my 3 day Split PPL a bit.

As for my macros, it looked like this:
Training Days 2900 Calories, High Protein, High Carbs, Low Fat
Rest Days 2100 Calories, High Protein, Low Carbs, High Fat
I bulked from October 2016 to March 2017 and put on around 20 pounds.
https://i.imgur.com/2HYDCcJ.jpg
So in March, I started a cut to shed a bit of the fat that I got while doing this lean bulk. I finished it in June at around 175lbs. I was doing the same program. Just added some cardio 3 days (10k).
As for the macros: 
Training Days 2100 Calories, High Protein, High Carbs, Low Fat
Rest Days 1700 Calories, High Protein, Low Carbs, High Fat
https://i.imgur.com/Zh6lK9K.jpg
Since then, I’ve switched to nsuns 5days program and upped my calories to go into maintenance/recomp. I’m still getting leaner so I guess everything is going great.",

Folks, today I learned that there are people out there that use software tools to
derail
eBay listings for scalped graphics cards. Yes, that's right... people are using software to give themselves an unfair advantage in the exchange of PC hardware from manufacturers to consumers! WHO WOULD DO SUCH A THING!?  For example,
see this well-known, already completed, eBay auction
from days ago. Evil cyber criminals decimated this totally innocent and honest listing with dozens of fake bids. They bidded so rapidly, the lister couldn't even
cancel them
all - So sad!
Doing this isn't a good idea because it could get your account banned from eBay... unless you were to use, say, a
VPN service
to make a bunch of throwaway eBay accounts and stockpile their logins in a spreadsheet or something haha... IDK... or maybe everyone in the bid history is safe as long as the upper-most bid is fake? I don't entirely know how this dark underbelly criminal enterprise works, I'm just here to get the word out. So very shocking, all of this.
Again, do NOT do this. Scalpers are providing a
valuable service
to the PC gaming community when they pay $5 for bot scripts that snap up entire shipments of hardware from etailers and then automatically create auctions on other websites, pulling a 10x turnaround before the hardware even hits the first warehouse's shelves. It would be wrong to use bot scripts to deprive them of their right to trade graphics cards -
just put yourselves in their shoes
. They would
never
use technology maliciously to deprive
you
of a graphics card trade, would they? No. Never.
Also - do not
create
,
share
, and use bot scripts or other software tools designed to derail these auctions with said throwaway eBay accounts (fully automated, or machine-assisted via URL scraping, doesn't matter). It's simply a very immoral and reprehensible thing to do. This should go without saying, but it's also very wrong to create and share public anti-scalper Telegram channels and Discord servers with the sole purpose of sharing eBay listings with each other for you, or your bid-bombing bots, to... well... bid-bomb. Very bad - do not do.
Again - Please do not do any of these things. They will only get the account, and its hundreds (possibly thousands, if you bot) of dirty bids, banned from eBay (unless, again, the account merely drove up the bid price but wasn't the winner of the auction - they'd just be able to claim ""Oh, I bought something else because I didn't win. If only you had told me 5 minutes sooner. Darn!"").
Just imagining the
distraught and panicked
look on this poor scalper's face when they're forced to stay up late into the night doing
real, actual work
, cancelling bids for hours on end as new stock trickles back onto the shelf should be enough to motivate you to not do it. They'd miss out on so many interactions with their loving friends and family that definitely exist. It just breaks my heart! What kind of
awful
person would use bot software to turn the tides of online sales in their own favor and deprive PC users of hardware? So very sad... to think, with each passing week, the shelf price falls further and further below what the scalpers paid on launch day... sometimes to the point that they might begin to wonder if their main source of income being ""owning someone else's graphics cards"" was a smart long-term idea...
So, anyways... thanks for reading.",

Amd,https://old.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/gmp45o/the_zen_3_architecture_is_coming_to_amd_x470_and/,17099,2272,"The ""Zen 3"" Architecture is Coming to AMD X470 and B450","As we head into our upcoming “Zen 3” architecture, there are considerable technical challenges that face a CPU socket as long-lived as AMD Socket AM4. For example,
we recently announced
that we would not support “Zen 3” on AMD 400 Series motherboards due to serious constraints in SPI ROM capacities in most of the AMD 400 Series motherboards. This is not the first time a technical hurdle has come up with Socket AM4 given the longevity of this socket, but it
is
the first time our enthusiasts have faced such a hurdle.
Over the past week, we closely reviewed your feedback on that news: we watched every video, read every comment and saw every Tweet. We hear that many of you hoped for a longer upgrade path. We hear your hope that AMD B450 and X470 chipsets would carry you into the “Zen 3” era.
Our experience has been that large-scale BIOS upgrades can be difficult and confusing especially as processors come on and off the support lists.  As the community of Socket AM4 customers has grown over the past three years, our intention was to take a path forward that provides the safest upgrade experience for the largest number of users. However, we hear you loud and clear when you tell us you would like to see B450 or X470 boards extended to the next generation “Zen 3” products.
As the team weighed your feedback against the technical challenges we face, we decided to change course. As a result, we will enable an upgrade path for B450 and X470 customers that adds support for next-gen AMD Ryzen™ Processors with the “Zen 3” architecture. This decision is very fresh, but here is a first look at how the upgrade path is expected to work for customers of these motherboards.
1) We will develop and enable our motherboard partners with the code to support “Zen 3”-based processors in select beta BIOSes for AMD B450 and X470 motherboards.
2) These optional BIOS updates will disable support for many existing AMD Ryzen™ Desktop Processor models to make the necessary ROM space available.
3) The select beta BIOSes will enable a one-way upgrade path for AMD Ryzen Processors with “Zen 3,” coming later this year. Flashing back to an older BIOS version will not be supported.
4) To reduce the potential for confusion, our intent is to offer BIOS download only to verified customers of 400 Series motherboards who have purchased a new desktop processor with “Zen 3” inside. This will help us ensure that customers have a bootable processor on-hand after the BIOS flash, minimizing the risk a user could get caught in a no-boot situation.
5) Timing and availability of the BIOS updates will vary and may not immediately coincide with the availability of the first “Zen 3”-based processors.
6) This is the final pathway AMD can enable for 400 Series motherboards to add new CPU support. CPU releases beyond “Zen 3” will require a newer motherboard.
7) AMD continues to recommend that customers choose an AMD 500 Series motherboard for the best performance and features with our new CPUs.
There are still many details to iron out, but we’ve already started the necessary planning. As we get closer to the launch of this upgrade path, you should expect another blog just like this to provide the remaining details and a walkthrough of the specific process.
At CES 2017, AMD made a commitment: we would
support AMD Socket AM4 until 2020
. We’ve spent the next three years working very hard to fulfill that promise across four architectures, plus pioneering use of new technologies like chiplets and PCIe® Gen 4. Thanks to your feedback, we are now set to bring “Zen 3” to the AMD 400 Series chipsets. We’re grateful for your passion and support of AMD’s products and technologies.
We’ll talk again soon.",

WHAT WE CANNOT DISCUSS
AMD is a publicly-traded company in the US, and it must comply with certain laws and regulations. Chief amongst those regulations is
Regulation Fair Disclosure
(RegFD), mandated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. This law states that AMD must disclose previously unknown product or financial information to all investors simultaneously. Not every investor reads Reddit, so Reddit cannot be a platform for new or unreleased product info. We have to issue press releases (or similar) for information like that!
So: if you haven't seen it mentioned in an official AMD presentation, investor update, press release, blog, or webpage we legally cannot comment. Sorry, y'all. That also means we can't discuss much on VEGA.
Let's do this!
//EDIT: Hi, everyone! Winners are being contacted right now. Stay tuned. Reminder: entry cutoff was at noon CST on 3/3.
//EDIT #2: Still waiting on 5 confirmations from winners. Check your PMs, folks.

Even nvidia had the courtesy of giving 72 hours for potential customers to decide whether or not the price to performance ratio was worth it.
We know the RDNA2 cards will be in short supply and high demand. Regardless of performance, they'll sell because if you want new hardware this year, you don't really have a choice... But this exclusively hurts the early adopting enthusiasts who are unwilling to buy something without being knowledgeable about their purchase. By the time they get the information they need from reviews, they'll be sold out and they'll be stuck waiting god knows how long to get another shot with decent supply.
RTX3000 series AIB review embargoes dropped the minute they went up for sale too but at least consumers knew the baseline performance for the FE cards. We don't even have that. Between the SAM debacle and the review embargo situation for Zen 3 and RDNA2, personally they've pissed any good will I had towards them as they become just another scummy corporation doing scummy things with cultists worshipping every anti-consumer move they make.
This benefits nobody except for AMD and day traders that will flip the stock the second it's inconvenient to them
(and speaking as an investor that bought at $2.24/share a couple years ago, I'm not happy about this, it leads me to believe they have something to hide, I'm just pointing this out because I literally have a financial incentive for AMD to do well and even I don't support these practices).
Edit: The responses here are fucking pathetic. When AMD becomes the next Intel, you'll deserve it with your shitty cult worship.",

One major point of clarification on the second part of this post's title:
Intel was not fully ordered to ""stop"" sending AMD owners down a slow execution path. In the conclusion of the FTC's investigation, they were only legally ordered to stop doing it in secret, which they have done in a maliciously minimal way. This is how they're able to get away with it - a misstep of justice, but legally passable. See the bottom summary for more information!
A few days ago,
a small internet uproar
occured when it was discovered that Intel's MKL (that powers Matlab) changes its performance not based on CPU features, but on the company that made the CPU.
I made a
stickied comment
there initially intending to summarize and compile the important details, but in doing so I fell down a rabbit hole. I'm not a trade lawyer, but this stuff seems pretty damning with even a general layman's scan.
I dug into an old
FTC investigation from 2009-2010
that
determined
, not only did the FTC
order
intel to STOP doing exactly what they're doing today, but they
call out Intel's Math Kernel Library by name
(which can be found in the last page of the conclusion):
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent shall not make any engineering or design change to a Relevant Product if that change (1) degrades the performance of a Relevant Product sold by a competitor of Respondent and (2) does not provide an actual benefit to the Relevant Product sold by Respondent, including without limitation any improvement in performance, operation, cost, manufacturability, reliability, compatibility, or ability to operate or enhance the operation of another product; provided, however, that any degradation of the performance of a competing product shall not itself be deemed to be a benefit to the Relevant Product sold by Respondent. Respondent shall have the burden of demonstrating that any engineering or design change at issue complies with Section V. of this Order.
The only way Intel can avoid guilt from this statement is by either proving that the version of the compiler Matlab uses is from before the settlement, or by falling under this exception:
Provided, however, that the fact that the degradation of performance of a Relevant Product sold by a competitor of Respondent arises from a “bug” or other inadvertent product defect in and of itself shall not constitute a violation of Section V.A.1. Respondent shall have the burden of demonstrating that any such degradation of performance was inadvertent.
Can anyone else make sense of this? How is a multi billion dollar company in seemingly blatant violation of an order from the Federal Trade Commision (continuously) for almost 10 years after getting caught?

. Here,
/u/night0x63
finds that (legally speaking) Intel may actually not be required to
stop
sabotaging performance, but ""skirted"" a bit, and is legally required to
disclose
that they do. As
/u/demonstar55
points out,
this disclaimer is present in the footnotes if you want to read it
. (using a blurry GIF image, which is immune to search engine crawling and keyword searching)!
/u/smartcom5
discovered that Intel, at some point, converted it to an image and trimmed off a lot of useful information. tl;dr: Write things very carefully if you work in the FTC.
IN SUMMARY
Thanks to more digging by people who are much better at interpreting legal documents than I, we have concluded how and why Intel is able to do this, despite being investigated for it:
Intel's Math Kernel Library is NOT a compiler, incase anyone confuses it with one. Doesn't really matter to the FTC or consumers, but some wished to stress this.
How Intel gets away with it: The ""Relevant Products"" section means (i) Relevant Microprocessor Products and (ii) Relevant GPUs (as defined on PAGE 5).
Intel's MKL may hurt performance of AMD processors, but almost nothing uses it (you're probably not ever going to use it)
Other Intel compilers and libraries have done this in the past
The FTC investigated them and, at the very least, requires them to disclose what they do
It's wrong regardless, but at least it's limited to very few consumer software products (currently)
The great debate: Is it wrong to build libraries and compilers to utilize technologies that have been industry compatibility standard for years, and only use those features if the CPU is made by yourself? The FTC thinks so. Consumers think so. But, ultimately, the FTC is happy to live with it as long as Intel discloses this dark behavior to the millions that use and rely on down-stream technology, and the misleading benchmarks it helps fabricate...

AMD is not your friend.
This is purely 100% a business decision.
Consumers defending this are exactly why these tech companies gouge and become so complacent with anti consumer practices in the first place. I mean just look at Nvidia and their sky high prices, but it doesn't matter because people are still buying their cards, and that's the go ahead signal that tells them to keep fucking us.
Intel got made fun of all this time because 9900Ks could have worked on many Z170 boards. But they chose to artificially create a segmentation and force people to upgrade. People used AMD as example, ""oh Intel why can you be more like amd"".
But now AMD are finding themselves in the exact same shoes, but this time it's ""well hur durr they didn't promise you anything get over it"". It's not a matter of promising, it's a matter of providing people the full benefit for their product. Ryzen 4000 should have been compatible but it's not for the stupidest reason that's been debunked.
AMD just because you're winning now does warrant you to indulge in anti consumer behavior now.
EDIT: It's sad and also hilarious at the same time to see so many people turn a blind-eye to this when its literally the same thing all these guys gave Intel shit for.
EDIT 2: If there was an alternative universe where DOOMGUY had to go around slaying AMD fanboys, I think even he would quit because of how fucking insufferable these people are.
EDIT 3: For the people saying I'm entitled and saying I'm preventing amd from making money are missing the point. Im not saying amd shouldn't conduct their business, but just know that we need to be aware of their true motives and any sort anti-consumer tactics should be called out. If you stay quiet and continue to let them do whatever, then don't be surprised when the next gen cpus aren't as cheap as you thought they were going to be.",

30 CPUs in Cyberpunk at 720p
found that the 10900k can match the 5950X and beat the 5900X, while the 5600X performs about equal to a i5 10400F.
While the article doesn't mention it, if you run the game on an AMD CPU and check your usage in task manager, it seems to utilise 4 (logical, 2 physical) cores in frequent bursts up to 100% usage, where as the rest of the physical cores sit around 40-60%, and their logical counterparts remaining idle.
Here is an example using the 5950X (3080, 1440p Ultra RT + DLSS)
And 720p Ultra, RT and DLSS off
A friend running it on a 5600X reported the same thing occuring.
Compared to an Intel i7 9750H, you can see that all cores
are being utilised
equally, with none jumping like that.
This could be deliberate optimisation or a bug, don't know for sure until they release a statement. Post below if you have an older Ryzen (or intel) and what the CPU usage looks like.
Edit:
Beware that this should work best with lower core CPUs (8 and below) and may not perform better with high core multi-CCX CPUs (12 and above, etc), although some people are still reporting improved minimum frames
Thanks to
/u/UnhingedDoork
's post about
hex patching the exe to make the game think you are using an Intel processor
, you can try this out to see if you may get more performance out of it.
Helpful step-by-step instructions I also found
And even a video tutorial
Some of my own quick testing:
720p low, default exe, cores fixed to 4.3Ghz
: FPS seems to hover in the 115-123 range
720p low, patched exe, cores fixed to 4.3Ghz
: FPS seems to hover in the 100-112 range, all threads at medium usage (So actually worse FPS on a 5950X)
720p low, default exe, CCX 2 disabled
: FPS seems to hover in the 118-123 range
720p low, patched exe, CCX 2 disabled
: FPS seems to hover in the 120-124 range, all threads at high usage
1080P Ultra RT + DLSS, default exe, CCX 2 disabled
: FPS seems to hover in the 76-80 range
1080P Ultra RT + DLSS, patched exe: CCX 2 disabled
: FPS seems to hover in the 80-81 range, all threads at high usage
From the above results, you may see a performance improvement if your CPU only has 1 CCX (or <= 8 cores). For 2 CCX CPUs (with >= 12 cores), switching to the intel patch may incur a performance overhead and actually give you worse performance than before.
If anyone has time to do detailed testing with a 5950X,
this is a suggested table
of tests, as the 5950X should be able to emulate any of the other Zen 3 processors.",

Beats the 10900k in most games for less than half the price and with less cores.
Draws less power than the previous gen 3300X (both at stock)
Once GPU bound (above 1080p), it equals and sometimes even beats, the 5950X
In fact, Steve has given it the Best Gaming CPU outright tag, with one asterisk... except in RDR2. Even against the higher spec Zen3 CPU's it wins.

Coming from an ancient craptop ""powered"" by an i7 2600 QM, I thought I couldn't do anything wrong anyways, the performance gain will be too huge either way.
I invested quite some time in researching for some proper components for my first own desktop build. And I have to confess, I was pretty hyped about the Ryzen 3000 Desktop CPUs. So I thought, lets just give it a try.
And then, after I've built it I was just blown away by the performance. I won't need to upgrade it in the next couple of years OMG!
So as long as nothing gets broken, AMD will not get a single cent by me, neither will other hardware manufacturers.

Honestly, the battlestations on

r/battlestations
for a reason. This is an AMD subreddit, not a place for people to show off their new builds. It gets annoying and it's counterproductive to me—we could have much more interesting conversations over ""oooh look at my PC."" I think the battlestation posts should completely disappear. This is literally just promoting the terrible ideal of ""I spend 2000 dollars, I get 2000 upvotes.""

Throughout the entire game he goes on about how bad his teammates are and that the way they play should be bannable. All while being 2/8 before ending 2/11.
After this he bans 20+ people from his chat after he went over the vod and asked twitch chat who's fault that game was and they responded 'you'.
How is this guy not indefinitely banned? All of this happened while streaming to his young, impressionable fan base.
Edit: For the people asking for
a clip of him afking
. Sat in base while his team wanted to keep playing. Unfortunately I can't get a clip from the stream because vods are sub only. Would like to add that he had said earlier in the stream that he would have afked earlier if he wasn't streaming.",

I've been playing League for over nine years now, and the dream always was to be above average. It's not a big dream, but there you go.
When we still had ELO, that meant being above 1200 (I never was). As soon as we had the ranked system, I wanted to be Gold. That's where the shiny borders are. That's where you get skins. That's where you can tell people you're actually kinda decent at this game.
The problem always was that I suck. My already non-existent mechanical skills managed to deteriorate even further after I hit 40. I also can't play every day, since my family and my job come first. And there's always too much happening on the screen for me to follow. I regularly confuse my own character with one of my teammates. I'm incapable of outplaying anyone.
So what I do is play braindead champions in the toplane, disable chat, ward as much as possible, bash towers whenever I can, and let the young folk carry me.
This afternoon it finally happened. I goofed around on Garen a bit while my Draven killed everyone and everything, and at the end of that game I was Gold. I'm absolutely ecstatic, but no one I know plays League. In fact, everyone I know thinks I'm a bit of a twat to still play videogames at my age. But to me this is a big thing.
So there you go. And I'm pretty sure if I can do this, any one of you can too!",

So I will try to keep this anonymous as possible, though it's quite hard given my current situation. I've been playing League of Legends for 6 years under the alias Squid Corona - squids are my favourite animal and Corona, believe it or not, is my real life surname.
As I'm sure everyone is well aware, there is a global pandemic called COVID-19 or, as very inconveniently for me, better known as Coronavirus. Trust me, I've heard all the jokes possible from friends and co-workers.
At the start of 2019 I managed to change my in-game name to just ""Corona"" as I thought the shorter version of my name was nicer, worked well with telling my real life friends to add me on League, as they all know it's my surname and I think Corona is a cool name so why not have just that. I had to use one of those third party sites to check the name and stay up till midnight in order to secure my family name in League (as a side note, Riot should really consider implementing a bot-detect system to stop name sniping).
I'm by most descriptions a casual player - I play one or two games a day of normal draft pick, almost always with friends just as a way of relaxing after work. On the 1st of April, I try to login to be greeted with a message telling me I need to change my name in order to proceed. I thought it was amusing at first, as almost every game a player would say in chat ""nice name"" to me, but I just shrugged my shoulders and emailed Riot in the hopes of them agreeing that it was a funny situation, and my name would be white-listed.
After two weeks of back and forth with multiple ""Player Support Specialists"", I was told that they had come to the conclusion that my name would not get white-listed and that I would have to change it if I wanted to keep playing League of Legends.
This is specially stupid since in other regions, players with the name Corona are still active and playing.
This to me is all very disappointing. I haven't chosen the name ""Corona"" for any reason, and certainly haven't done it during the covid-19 outbreak. I feel like Riot are just sticking a big middle finger to me and telling me that my family name is inappropriate to be a part of their game. I'm posting this to reddit because I want to know if the community really feels offended by the summoner name ""Corona"", or if I'm right in feeling a mild rage and sense of unfairness.

with the classic ""Challenger Akali Visits Iron4"" Title
And a comment brought to my attention that he intentionally lost 16 games in a row to get to play in this rank so i went and checked it my self
So i Opened op.gg and searched the name of the account he was playing on in the video ""ProfessorIRONxd"" and geuss what there where no account with this name
So i searched the name of his jungler playing zac ""Wreck It Ralph**""** And found the game that had the fed akali in it , which is his only zac game go check it if u want
https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Wreck+It+Ralph
And i found out that he changed the account name to ""reeeeeeent"" Right after he finished making this video his op.gg
https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=reeeeeeent
and if u check this op.gg  ur gonna find that the last 3 games played where akali games that he won (last one played is the one in the video) but before that all of the other games is him going 0/8 ,0/13  etc for 16 games in a row
Now Tell me is it ok for a player for ruin the experince of 70 players just to make a youtube video styling on low elo player?

After a long day on the ranch, I pour myself a tall glass of milk, huff some paint, and log on to the Dell I got for Christmas in 2006 with Windows XP to play some League of Legends.
The client needs to patch. That's fine. I reheat a bowl of beans and lard for supper, and it's already at 13% by the time I get back, well ahead of schedule. I huff some more paint to pass the time, and oh boy does it pass. The client is ready to go by 7:30. Everybody keeps saying it's laggy, but I don't notice any difference from usual. Maybe I'm just too intelligent, or maybe the paint is finally doing its job.
I queue up solo - normal blind pick of course. The queue pops, and Clippy asks me if I want help selecting my champion. Not now not ever, I think boastfully at the cartoon paper clip. I lock in Dr. Munro. My teammates pick Shaco and all the others pick hot anime girls. I take one last good long huff to get ready for the game, and in we go.
The first thing I notice is that their team doesn't have a dt Munford. Free win then. I go top lane. I always go top lane. They have a Aatrod. Pathetic. I hit the minions. I miss some crepes bc I have 450 ping. Aatrox tries ro hit me but I heal up bc I'm drMindoro.
Midgame I have sunfire and I tp botlane to gank. They have thst new champ Aphelios shootijg weird bubble guns at me. There's a tirret or sometbjng? Idk anuway I kill him by running at his face pressing e amd right clicking him to death. I miss all three cleavers I throw. It doesn't matter.
20 min latr a D really stsrting to feel the paint. I have sjnfire warmogd spirit vosage and tp to baroj for teamfigyt. Aphekios knows he's dead as soon as tp channle starts. He tries to get away by rooting me or sokething? Idk anyway I press ult and run him down. I forgot ti buy boots. It doesnt matter. I get four kills by pressijg e and right ckickijg with my w on. Thst bitch Lux stole my penta.
Game ocer. Another win for Dr mubdo. So in concolustn, hello fellow summoner. This you should just play mondarb against aphelios. He kill gun guy good. Thank you. Thank you. If you kill gun man, anime grliss hot. they'll be lower son. The Dr mildew play is right thing to do. So doooooo",

I'm gay. I've struggled with my personal identity my entire life. While my parents were working in China, I moved around a lot from homestay to homestay, which is basically where you live in a stranger's home. At the age of 8, I was bombarded with homophobic and sexist remarks at home, and whenever I did something that wasn't ""manly,"" I was told, ""Why are you acting like a girl?"" and to stop being ""gay."" I was hyper-conscious of how I should act and tried not to act or sound ""gay,"" but I was still constantly bullied at school for it. No child should have to feel like they don't belong. Working in the video game industry hasn't helped matters either. On almost every team I've been on, I've heard homophobic comments from either my teammates or the staff and felt uncomfortable, even borderline afraid of possibly losing my job if I told the truth. I'm at a point in my life where I've accepted who I am, and it's taken me a long time to get there. My story is not unique. The gaming industry is rampant with sexism, prejudice, and homophobia. I don't believe there's a quick fix, but it starts with us holding ourselves to a higher standard and treating everyone with dignity. We need to educate people in esports of proper conduct within the workplace. I'm not making this announcement because I owe everyone the details of my personal life, but because I want there to be more awareness about the problems our community faces. Thank you to my parents and friends who have made me feel like I belong. You the real ones.",
leagueoflegends,https://old.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/mw8kfy/goodbye_league_a_brief_love_letter_from_a/,31588,1054,"Goodbye, League: A brief love letter from a visually impaired player","I was not expecting today to be any different in terms of big life changes, it's really just a Thursday, pandemic seems to be easing up a little... But this morning, as I was playing draft pick, I understood something very painful: It was the last time I would play League of Legends.
I have been experiencing a very sudden process of sight loss due to untreated glaucoma since April 2020 that culminated in me hitting the threshold for legal blindness last December. All throughout the process, I kept playing League, as it was legitimately my favorite game and I had so much fun playing, but the past three months or so have been incredibly taxing, emotionally. I was playing more sporadically because even 15 minutes of straining my eyes leaves me with a migraine, but the more time that went between matches, the more noticeable my sight loss became whenever I logged in and sat for 30 minutes watching my gameplay worsen, the information slowly becoming something I could not parse. It was obviously not just the migraines, but the solidification of the fact that, well, fuck, I am going blind.
I know the community has a reputation for being jaded and toxic, and to an extent, I did get splashes of that experience, but honestly? My experience as a player was overwhelmingly positive. League was something for me to bond over with my real life friends, and a gateway to kind communities where I got to know online friends that would come to matter more to me than words could express. It was rewarding, I could see myself improve with practice, even if I never aimed for a high rank, and sitting down every night to play a few hours was the only thing that kept me going in what have been, quite frankly, a shit couple of years. When I think of League it's never the bad matches that stick with me, it's the neat outplays, the honest conversations about life in voice chat, the delight that came with messing around with builds and meeting people that I had this in common with.
Today was the day the loss finally hit. I was playing a Lux match, and understanding that even with my main, even with the more contrasting skin I could find, and all the color settings adjusted, and a giant monitor with a magnifier could not do anything about the fact that I just could not play because I could not see anything relevant. No abilities, no health bars, no indicators... My lack of peripheral vision also meant that all my attempts at hitting anything were mostly guesswork. Hell, the only reason I knew who I even was playing was the color of the blurry HP bar that took up a quarter of my monitor.
I don't think I can kid myself anymore into thinking that things will remain the same even as this huge part of my life changes into something unknown and terrifying. I hate that League of all things was what made me understand how real and irreversible the sight loss is, but it is what it is. So today, I have decided that I have played my last game of League. I did not savor it. I did not prep a goodbye party, and if this is a goodbye speech then it's kind of shitty.
I would still like to make use of this cheesy word vomit to thank League players and the team behind the game. You've brought many things to my life that I hope will remain now that League is no longer in it, and I am grateful. Regardless of what comes next, I will remember these times in my life fondly, and that's pretty much invaluable.
Thank you, it's been great. See you on the flip side.",

Overall timeline
Streamer got sniped by 4 people. 2 in her team(Nasus, Jhin) and 2 in the enemy team(Evelynn, Senna)
Can't end game by voting surrender since you cannot get the numbers
Nasus and Jhin cleared minions to prevent the nexus from being destroyed
Senna and Evelynn prevented her from doing backdoor(Nasus and Jhin tell them where she is)
Game goes on for over 3 hours. Death count of streamer was over 120
Streamer got banned 14 days by riot (snipers reported her by negative attitude and intentional feeding). Some say why not just leave the game, but she would've got banned for afk then.",

We know they really don't want to be in the big pond with the big fish, and this action is taken to prevent exactly that. Swain is a meme pick--we recommend gold players and below actually perform their due diligence by listening to their overlords, the mega hot streamers and diamond youtube content creators.
""...the limit of three games will be imposed until Swain's winrate has returned to normal. Thank you for understanding!""
As well, players silver and below will no longer be allowed to play Rammus. Highly respected and diamond-ranked coach BaldBaby92 claims that this move will ""stop the plebes from ruining my games, or taking Swain from me in Champ Select.""

leagueoflegends,https://old.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/hyr8dn/red_side_cannon_minions_have_20_lower_attack/,28279,1161,"Red Side Cannon Minions have 20 lower attack range than Blue Side ones (for 11 years, since Alpha)","I was writing a new wiki page about
unit size
the other day. One of the size modifiers that exists is Baron Buff, which only affects minions, but sure enough, this page was about non-champion sizes, too.
So after I set out to determine those modifiers, I also wanted to confirm the attack range increases on the Baron Buff page, which I asked a friend to get me. For the Cannon Minions, he returned '1050/1030 total range'.
I looked at those 2 values the same way you are right now. Nope, this isn't about other minions on any separate map; these are SR cannon minions. The Blue Cannon has 300 attack range; The Red Cannon only has 280 range!
As it turned out, this has been a bug since the earliest builds of the game we have access to; all the way back from Alpha! Minions are coded as separate units for both sides of the map; So are skins, technically, albeit they properly draw from the same data file for the gameplay side (the only differences are tags like 'human' and 'freljord' which VO interactions use). Same types of minions...do not draw from the same file. Not a big problem, though, as they only have to get a few values right? Yes, in theory, that isn't a big problem.
Unfortunately, in the game right now,
this
is an excerpt the Blue Cannon Minion data file
, and
this is the same excerpt in the data for the Red Cannon minion
. apart from the Name ID's, notice a difference?
And indeed, in the game, these minions adhere to those range values.
[If you make 2 opposing cannons run into each other without interference, they'll not always start attacking each other at the same time like same-ranged units would](see *Edit below for why this link is missing) - instead the Blue Minion goes first a lot of times. The reason it doesn't happen always is that 'is my enemy in attack range yet' is checked only so often, which is also why attacking an enemy moves your champion slightly closer than their attack range would require most of the time. Some would argue that that is to aid in chasing/orb-walking, but I don't think it was set up with that in mind. In any case, attack pathfinding at least doesn't path you into Dragon pit if you want to attack someone on the other side of that wall that is in range of Dragon pit at the time, which would be dumb.
Edit: I got some help in re-doing the proof for this:
Using Syndra W, we can get exact range values and eliminate the
'is my enemy in attack range yet' check
by throwing the minion straight from inside its range to slightly further than it was before. If it attacks without walking, it's inside its attack range; If it nudges forward first, it was thrown further than it's attack range.
Test with Blue Cannon
|
Test with Red Cannon
Here is a
comparison for the longest throw at which the minion doesn't nudge forward (= is still in attack range) at.
The difference isn't large (it's about 5% of attack range against a normal-sized champion), but you can see it
via the cursor location.
Also,
there's a Ryze bug that made separating these minions kinda annoying yet kind of fun.
This is the reason you canot port a single Rift Herald, or a single minion period, btw (first minion takes last ported champion's position, or won't get a new location at all if no champion was ported).
I tried showing off this difference in the one patch where the new HUD showed unit ranges in the collapsed version (5.14),
however minions all show as 0-ranged anyway due to ((bug))
. Which is sad, maybe someone would have noticed it then already!
The fact that blue team seems to generally win when the game is left alone by players entirely might be due to this bug. Blue team also has a higher winrate overall in the game, which is often attributed to the assymetry in HUD and the map, which is reasonable, but I wonder what the impact of this bug has been on that winrate, afterall.
*Edit: Turns out the mentioned tickrates make this way too hard, and upon reviewing the best clip I have, it has minion damage increase due to my target dummies leveling up, so
I'll remake this for you with a proof that's less up-to chance.
Edit2: Remade proof. Now definitive. See above.
TL:DR
:
Spot the difference
Edit: Would you believe it, turns out this bug is LITERALLY fixed on PBE this cycle already. I did all this confirmation work for naught. Well, at least we know the fix will be in 10.16 (next full patch), most likely!",

All he talked about was League and I had never played a computer game in my life. I did not understand why he couldn't just stop mid-game when I needed him to. I did not understand his love of esports. We were drifting apart.
So, I asked him to teach me how to play.
To say that it was a steep learning curve is an understatement. But I kept at it because I loved him. The more I understood about the game, the closer we got. After some disastrous games on Summoner's Rift (where I was rightly flamed for not knowing how to ping), I switched to just playing ARAM because it forced me to learn what all champions do. It was also more chill.
While I was never very good and never tried playing ranked, I understood enough to enjoy watching the LCK, MSI and Worlds. In 2019, my son and I travelled to Taiwan together to watch both of the semifinals of MSI. It is a memory that I will always cherish.
Now that he has grown up and left home, I don't play anymore but I am so grateful that I made the effort to understand the game he loved. Definitely worth.",

If I just abandon the game, I get punished for AFK but there's no other in-game thing I can do to stop being griefed? During this match there were four players who paired as two duos, popped into each other (now they control both teams ff's). By the time anybody realized what was happening, the duos were farmed enough to 2v3. So whenever a team went to end, they would communicate to their friends on the enemy team and prevent a team from ending the game.
I've learned that this is something they've planned and executed before:
https://twitter.com/mordeeasy2getlp/status/936469118097571840
and that Riot actually encountered this game and didn't look into any possibility of collusion. In fact, they arguably celebrated this here:
https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-au/2017/11/ask-riot-longest-game-ever/
Here's their youtube upload of the prior colluded game:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahxwlzP0FX0
I just have no idea what i'meant to do against such organized and dedicated griefing. I can't submit a ticket, i'll just get told to report them in post-game and they do the usual nothing about a ticketed complaint. So I need to get to end screen to report them. Oh btw, the client has bugged on end screen and i'm stuck at ""skip waiting for stats"" so now I can't even report them.",

I’ve always been one of the ones that’s aware the world of Pokémon is a lot darker than the games and mainline TV show let on. I’ve watched Beloved Pokémon get shot in the face. Dead. I’ve seeing team rocket poaching slowpokes and unlike in the game they didn’t stop at cutting off the tail.
The reason all the adults in the game are afraid of fighting team rocket, while a 10-year-old beats the shit out of them is because the adults live in a world where team rocket will shoot you and your Pokémon mid battle the only reason you win is plot armor.
This game has all that I feel like I’ve been trapped on a lost island of Pokémon with all the proper dangers of wild Pokémon. There’s survivors and half of them have formed a team much like rocket
Here  is hoping Nintendo’s lawsuit fails because honestly I see way more than just Pokémon in this game.

It gave me the same sense of wonder and engagement I got from playing similar games on my Gameboy back when I was a kid. For a while, I was just running around doing everything on my own, figuring it out as I could and got to about level 30.
Then, once the first resource wall hit and I had to travel irl, I started looking up YouTube videos and tips. Which turned into looking up guides and best pals and once I got home I started following them. Little by little the game lost all it's wonder it became like every other game where I was following the optimal route, optimal building techniques to get past the grinds quicker.
Next thing you know, I inevitable spoiled who the legendaries are, bosses and everything in between. I'm still only level 40 and still seeing new pals out in the world, but it's not longer playing for fun now its just breeding optimal pals, capturing a ton for exp and moving on to next area.
I'm doing solo with default server settings and unfortunately my brain that's been trained to be meta oriented and efficiency oriented has somewhat ruined the end game.
TLDR: If you're just starting out, enjoy your first playthrough slowly because once you spoil it, there's no going back.",

Introduction
Hello everyone, I am Ravi Singh—
the real
Ravi Singh. I am a victim of
KYC impersonation
who has been battling with multiple Indian banks and NBFCs for the past year. My goal is to protect my
CIBIL score
and financial credibility from fraudulent activities perpetrated by scammers who somehow obtained my
PAN
and
Aadhaar
details.
In this post, I want to share my ordeal in detail. This story highlights the failures of several banks (KreditBee, Axis Bank, Poonawalla Fincorp, ICICI Bank, and finally HDFC) in detecting and preventing fraud. It also explains how the
RBI Ombudsman
process works, and how you can protect your rights.
There were 72+ enquiries in my CIBIL in the past 12 months but these banks proved to be the most deceptive and cunning in their practices and support.
So, grab a cup of coffee, settle in, and learn from my struggle on how to fight bank fraud and protect your financial reputation in India.
The Shocking CKYC Update (January 2024)
CKYC (Central KYC)
is a centralized repository of customer identification information. One day, I received an email stating there had been changes in my CKYC record.
When I opened the attached PDF, I was shocked: all the details except my
name
and
date of birth
belonged to a
fraudster
—including someone else’s photo, address, and phone number. Lived all my life in NCR. This picture in CKYC is of the fraudster who was able to get KreditBee loan of INR 10K.
CKYC Data reported by KreditBee, It was later Fixed by KreditBee Only After RBI Compliant
I immediately contacted the CKYC helpdesk and learned that
KreditBee
had updated my CKYC records.
KreditBee’s Role
KreditBee insisted I had taken a
10,000 INR
loan and claimed they had transferred the amount to
my Axis Bank account
(which, as I would later discover, actually belonged to the fraudster). I have only two bank accounts and none (never) in Axis bank.
This fraudulent loan also appeared in my
CIBIL report
, showing mismatched details (the fraudster’s address and phone number, but my name and DOB).
KreditBee
refused
to remove it from my CIBIL despite me sending them KYC documents, my
cybercrime FIR
, my CIBIL report, and more.
Taking It to the RBI Ombudsman
In desperation, I lodged a complaint with the
RBI Ombudsman
against KreditBee, attaching all relevant documents.
After a lengthy back-and-forth (including video KYC verification to prove I was the real Ravi Singh), KreditBee finally agreed (around
March 2024
) to rectify and remove the loan from my CIBIL report.
KreditBee Accepted their Flaw and Rectified the CIBIL
KreditBee corrected my Details in CKYC As Well
Axis Bank’s Massive Breach (February–March 2024)
While I was still dealing with KreditBee,
another nightmare
unfolded:
I tried to use my Axis Bank credit card on Flipkart but never received any OTPs. I also didn’t get my February statement.
When I logged into the Axis Bank app, I discovered that
all my contact details
—phone numbers, email addresses, even my residential and work details—were replaced with the
fraudster’s
information.
Check the address, not mine, but of fraudster that matches CKYC data reported by KreditBee
This led me to realize that
the fraudster
was getting my OTPs and sensitive statements. This huge data breach allowed the scammer to potentially apply for more loans and credit cards in my name.
Around the same time, I noticed fresh
CIBIL inquiries
from Axis Bank.
Struggle with Axis Bank Support
Because my phone number was changed in Axis’s system, I couldn’t even authenticate myself as a customer.
Address reported by Axis Bank - the bank rejected the Dispute on CIBIL right away. And this was reported to CIBIL when my complaint was with PNO
Axis Bank Denying Rectifications and tried to deceive me and did their best to fool me. But I had learned from previous experience that only banks and NBFCs can correct these or rectify these even when they keep in denial mode.
After much effort, I found and emailed the
Principal Nodal Officer (PNO)
. Their replies were mostly
copy-paste
responses saying they were “working on it.” And their excuse was ""The name, PAN, and DoB"" used for fraudulant Card Application/loan matched mine in their system and so they changed my Address, Phone Number, Email. And they never informed me via call, SMS, or email about this change.
Axis Bank's One of the Initial Response after RBI Complaint
Eventually, I canceled my Axis Bank card to avoid further risk. Their official stance was that they had “no relationship” with me besides the canceled card and closed my service request without addressing the breach.
Second RBI Ombudsman Complaint
On
April 2, 2024
, I lodged another complaint with the RBI Ombudsman—this time against Axis Bank.
Axis Bank kept
denying
wrongdoing and repeatedly stated the same response to both me and the RBI.
It took
9 months
for them to finally rectify my CIBIL data in December 2024, a process they had previously claimed was impossible. I wrote literally 100 emails that took me several hours.
https://preview.redd.it/sqmongc4cade1.png?width=1894&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fcf70fd279496a3981988626d6872dd9f550e7b
Eventually, they
paid compensation
(I demanded more, given the magnitude of the breach and the stress caused), but my complaint with the RBI Ombudsman remained open for nearly
10 months
. Received partial compensation, waiting for the remaining, if RBI deems it valid.
A Wave of Fresh Loan Inquiries
From February 2024 onward, I continued to see
new loan inquiries
popping up occasionally in my CIBIL report. It seemed that the same fraudsters kept trying to open new accounts or apply for loans using my PAN. When I contacted various banks or NBFCs, most of them were cooperative and quickly fixed the errors—
except a few
.
Poonawalla Fincorp (April 2024)
April 2024
: I discovered a new
2.8 Lakh INR
loan from Poonawalla Fincorp in my CIBIL report.
They
ignored
my initial emails, and their PNO didn’t respond. When I called, he denied any conversation and threatened
police and court action
if I “shouted” at him.
Grievance officer for Delhi on 9876543498 – Gurmeet Singh
- This information is Public on Poonawalla website from where found it! He said this is my Personal number.
Public Info - Grievance office who Threatened me for FIR and Legal Threat
Personal loan account number reflecting in my CIBIL for INR 2.8Lakhs
I lodged a complaint with the RBI Ombudsman again.
Finally, a
supportive
representative from Poonawalla reached out, took my documents (Cybercrime FIR, KYC, etc.), and eventually
rectified
my CIBIL.
Cybercrime report. the IO did nothing and disposed of this with no comments. He never connected with me and when i called, didn't pick. Complaint to senior and commissioner also was of no use.
I did
not
demand compensation here because they were already hit financially by their own failure to identify the fraudster.
These details reported by Poonawalla are the same reported by Axis Bank, KreditBee - Scammer/fraudster is still using these details.

ICICI Bank (August 2024)
I’ve been an ICICI Bank customer since around
2014–15
, holding a savings account and a credit card.
On
June 9, 2024
, I received a CIBIL alert that
ICICI Bank
had made a credit card inquiry in my name.
https://preview.redd.it/4js437s7iade1.png?width=1120&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4e737973be7ef7ec24fa397f2ae52950508e1b7
I contacted them immediately, including my Relationship Manager (RM), but she was
unhelpful
, despite knowing about ongoing fraud on my PAN.
They denied. And this is when I am their existing customer with a card that has a really good limit - no help from the Grievance team, My so-called \""dedicated\"" relationship manager
Soon after, I got an SMS saying a
new credit card
(Adani card with a 5 Lakh INR limit) had been
dispatched
to scammer's same Jayanagar address. Understand the gravity here, they literally dispatched it to the address provided by the scammer while I am in their system for past 10 years and no change in my address when I am checking iMobile app or statements.
I insisted they cancel the card immediately. Though they canceled it, they
refused to rectify
my CIBIL record, claiming
I
had applied for the card.
Then I got two new enquiry again from ICICI while my complaint was with them in July 202
RBI Ombudsman—Again
Another
RBI Ombudsman
complaint forced ICICI Bank’s compliance team to investigate. And this is what they had top say initially which triggered a series of investigation by RBI.
They literally delivered the credit card issued to the scammer's address as shared in the response to the RBI complaint. At this stage, they did not realize what blunder they had made and thought that they were fine and it's the customer who was at fault - clearly not.
After about
two months
, they finally removed the fraudulent card entry from my CIBIL. I demanded compensation, pointing out the RM’s negligence. their PNO Rashmi was very supportive and dealt with my complaint very well - Thanks to RBI.
https://preview.redd.it/gyzshnzqjade1.png?width=2744&format=png&auto=webp&s=da3f8a1ea840aa061cbec028a0def60d38e86bc0
While the bank remains prone to such fraudulent inquiries, at least I now have a direct line to a
supportive PNO
.
HDFC Bank: The Most Cunning & Deceptive (April–December 2024)
Finally, we arrive at
HDFC Bank
, which has been the trickiest to deal with.
April 2024
: HDFC reported
two credit card inquiries
in my CIBIL.
You can See the HDFC April Enquiry here. And Axis bank still didn't stop from putting more enquiries.
I sent all proof (cybercrime FIR, KYC, etc.) but was
initially ignored
or told that I had applied for the card
After 30 days of no resolution, I lodged a complaint with the
RBI Ombudsman
.
HDFC’s False “Resolution”
HDFC eventually responded that they would do me a “
favor
” and rectify the inquiry, offering a 2,000 INR gift card
Look this was their resolution that I opposed after which they provided mixed logs of a genuine enquiry done in Novemebr 2023 - the complaint was never about this enquiry and the fraudulant one done in April 2024 - againt which I complaint with them and RBI.
I was offended by their tone, as if they were doing me a
personal favor
rather than fixing their own KYC failure.
I asked for an
apology
and demanded 10K INR compensation (willing to settle for 5K). This may have triggered them to not avoid paying me because if the accept their fault, they will have to pay. So they decided not to and presented misleading facts, fooling RBI Ombudsman beacuse I thing RBI deems the practice by HDFC valid which require no authentication from rightful owner of the PAN before fetching their damn reports. More about this below.
RBI Ombudsman’s Closure—on the Wrong Data
In
November 2024
, RBI Ombudsman
closed
the complaint, stating “no deficiency found” at HDFC’s end.
The
PNO, Mr. Ripal Seth
, had apparently
mixed
logs from a genuine inquiry I had made in
November 2023
with the fraudulent inquiry of
April 2024
, misleading the RBI into believing everything was legitimate.
https://preview.redd.it/irngvh1jmade1.png?width=2784&format=png&auto=webp&s=761a148462ea31022e9bbccef8aa1f05e5942700
Because this was an RBI final decision, my only recourse was going to court.
New HDFC Fraud in December 2024
On
December 2, 2024
, HDFC again reported
two more card inquiries
on my CIBIL.
I emailed the PNO (the same trail with RBI) and got no response for over a month.
On
January 13, 2025
, I filed a
new
RBI Ombudsman complaint, detailing how HDFC had
deceived
the RBI previously.
HDFC’s Fraud-Friendly Application System
Curious about how these inquiries keep happening, I decided to test HDFC’s
online credit card application
process:
All you need is someone’s PAN.
Enter any phone number
(not necessarily linked to that PAN).
HDFC
pulls
the CIBIL report for that PAN,
regardless
of whether the phone number or address matches the actual PAN holder.
If the PAN is found “eligible,” it can proceed to an “OTP verification” that might be tied to the
fake phone number
.
Here's the complete video. Please watch :
https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1i13lfx/how_hdfc_bank_enabling_fraudsters_to_exploit_pan/
This means
anyone
with your PAN can damage your CIBIL score, even if they don’t have your Aadhaar or other documents.
HDFC
doesn’t properly verify identity before pulling your CIBIL, so the
fraudster
effectively has a free pass to ruin your credit history.
When confronted,
HDFC
claims that “OTP verification” is enough proof of identity—and even the
RBI
has accepted this logic when presented with distorted facts. Meanwhile, innocent customers like me keep getting their CIBIL scores dented.
Why I am Sharing This
This took me 5-6 hours to prepare and structure my story and several hours and mental peace that I lost over last 12 month just beacuse Indian banks failing to validate or identify a simple fact which is their duty, i.e., ""to ensure that the person or applicat is really is who he/she claims to be."" Especially in todays digital age and in India where data privacy and protection are non-existent. There are no laws or regulations as such that a citizen can use even if he/she wants to pursue it legally.
I’m sharing this story to
warn the public
:
Monitor your CIBIL
regularly.
Stay alert
for unauthorized inquiries or accounts.
Keep an eye on your CKYC data
. Any change, immediately take clarification from CKYC who updated this and reach out to them for correction.
Lock your Aadhar Biometrics
to avoid any loan processing in your name and PAN. Enquiries won't stop with this but loans processing will.
Act quickly
with both the bank and the RBI Ombudsman if you spot fraud.
Don’t lose hope.
If you are honest and persistent, you will eventually get your record fixed.
These experiences show that
some Indian banks
—especially HDFC—are enabling fraudsters by having
poor KYC verification
procedures. When victims speak up, they often face denial, obfuscation, or blame-shifting as I showed in this post with all proofs. I have many more proofs but there is a limit of 20 images in a post on Reddit.
Even the RBI Ombudsman process can be misled if banks present
false or incomplete
data. There seems to be no checks!
Please share this post
, talk about it on social media, and
tag
the right people or authorities who can amplify the issue. We need proper checks and accountability in the banking system to ensure no one else goes through this mental stress, harassment, and potential financial ruin.
Thank you for reading.

You should get a 100% refund (almost)!,"Context - had booked a domestic return ticket earlier today through HDFC SmartBuy using a mix of points and card. A change in plan occurred shortly after and had to cancel the return leg. First time cancelling a flight ticket - quickly looked up any rules around cancellations within 24 hours and DGCA charter is very explicit - you get full refund barring convenience fee charged by the airline / aggregator if you meet two conditions -
Cancellation initiated with 24 hours
Travel date is more than 7 days away
DGCA sources for future reference if you need to quote.
Source 1 (section 3.e)
/
Source 2 (PDF page 8)
What to expect when you call for cancellation?
My experience -
Tried cancelling through the website on phone - the cancellation charges reflected as blank
Checked through laptop - showed I will get back INR 1,589 against a paid amount of 5,519 (71% loss)
Finally called up Yatra support (they don't make it easy at all to get their customer care number) - the executive put me on hold for 10 mins to figure my cancellation charges and later told me the same charges as in the screenshot - I will only get INR 1,589.
Magic words - all I had to say was - given my booking is less than 24 hours old, per DGCA I should get a full refund barring few charges, no? Immediately without a moment's break he responds 'yes, sir
in that case since this is a ""DGCA booking"" (whatever that means) only INR 320 convenience charge won't be refunded. THEY RELY ON YOUR LACK OF KNOWLEDGE TO MAKE MONEY. I will now be getting a refund of INR 5,199 (instead of INR 1,589) by just saying this one magical line. I tried to grill him on why did he even give me the lower refund amount - gave me BS that beat around the bush. Knowledge is power, truly.
Hence I thought to make this post in this group where people book a lot of flights using cc. Don't let the crooks at Yatra take you for a ride (pun intended).
Bonus - confirmed with HDFC Concierge - my points and card payment will be returned in the same format + got to know even the HDFC concierge can help with cancellation requests (the booking email mentioned contact OTA so didn't realise).",https://i.redd.it/byo5rz8i646f1.png

My friend was one night scrolling X (Formerly Twitter) where one OnlyF*ns(OF) model shared in a tweet that for tonight she is making her annual subscription free for 1 day. My friend went on the website to sign up and saw that it requires a credit card for creating the subscription which charges 0$. He went in and put his Credit Card details and brought the subscription.
Everything was going smooth and he got the invoice of 0$ being charged in his credit statement. In the next few minutes He got a call from his bank, There was a girl speaking and she asked ""Sir, We found some suspicious activity on your card, Wanted to confirm have you made any international payment to merchant OnlyF
ns ??"" 
My friend fumbled and straight away denied that the transaction wasn't his. Since he thought if he committed that he brought a OnlyF
ns Subscription, The girl on the phone will think he is some kind of pervert and he will feel embrassed.
The girl then said that she is cancelling the credit card citing the reason ""Unauthorised Transaction"" and you will not be able to use the card. You have to re apply for a new card. To which my friend accepted as he have no choice.
In the end my friend justified all this by saying
""Credit card dub jaaye beshak, Izzat nhi dubni chahiye"" (Meaning reputation is more important than a credit card)",
CreditCardsIndia,https://old.reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1kwfh1m/xuv700_bought_using_axis_atlas/,1835,187,XUV700 Bought using Axis Atlas,"Hey everyone,
I recently made a significant purchase – a new car – and I wanted to detail how my Axis Atlas credit card (which is Lifetime Free, by the way – no joining or annual fees!) played a crucial role in maximizing my rewards. It was a bit of a strategic move to optimize my benefits, and I think it paid off handsomely!
I made two significant payments for my new car.
For each transaction, there was a convenience fee applied, which is standard for large payments like this via credit card. Let's break down how much that cost me versus the points I earned:
Transaction 1 (Initial Payment): ₹375,550 (including a 1.5% charge). The fee component here was ₹5,550.
Transaction 2 (Remaining Balance): ₹343,799 (including a 2% charge). The fee component here was ₹6,741.16.
Total Extra Fees Paid: ₹12,291.16
Now, for the exciting part – the points!
 * From the first transaction, I received 7,510 Edge Miles.
 * This payment pushed my spending past ₹3 Lakh, bagging me an extra 2,500 Edge Miles instantly!
 * The second transaction yielded 6,874 Edge Miles.
 * Crucially, this payment, combined with some of my travel-related spending throughout the year, helped me achieve the ₹7.5 Lakh spend milestone, earning me another 2,500 Edge Miles!
Total Edge Miles Earned: 19,384 Edge Miles!
The real magic of the Axis Atlas card lies in its conversion rates. Here's how my Edge Miles translate into valuable Accor points and then into actual rupees:
 * Edge Miles to Accor Points: With 1 Edge Mile converting to 2 Accor Points, my 19,384 Edge Miles become a whopping 38,768 Accor Points!
 * Accor Points Value: Knowing that 1 Accor Point is valued at ₹1.9, the total value of my points is a significant ₹73,659.2!
After accounting for the fees I paid, the net value I achieved from using my Axis Atlas card for the car purchase is truly impressive:
 * Value of Points: ₹73,659.2
 * Less Total Fees Paid: ₹12,291.16
 * Net Value Achieved: ₹61,368.04!
To put this into perspective, let's look at the overall return. The total amount I spent on the card (including the fees) for the car was ₹719,349.
This means I effectively received a return of approximately 8.53% in the form of valuable Accor points, even after deducting the fees!",

This is not exactly news, but I am posting this here for the first time.
I worked in BOI and get my first Credit Card several years back.
(Read more about that here :
https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1cw9qso/
)
But now holding several good cards I no longer needed a BOI Credit Card.
So, I wrote an application to close it. And wrote a couple of more applications (There was no online method for this). More than an year passed and nothing happened.
Then came this new RBI Circular regarding Credit Cards which dictates new rules regarding various aspects of Credit Cards.
Specifically :
Penalty of Rs500/day if Bank fail to close a Credit Card within 7 days of request.
So, I wrote another application and kept the receipt, waited for a mandatory 30 days and escalated my complaint to RBI.
After 56 days (total), the bank decided to close my credit card and pay me Rs 28000 as compensation as per the circular.",

Unfortunately, they rejected me twice before birth apparently, ""fetal stage"" isn’t a valid KYC status.
Once I was born, I had a serious discussion with my RM. He suggested I drop ₹15 lakh into a ULIP for the card. I politely declined why should I gamble my milk money on market fluctuations? Instead, I escalated the matter to grievances, making my case:
I’d be the youngest Infinia holder ever.
I’d already spent ₹9 lakh in six months on diapers alone.
My toy budget for the next few years was looking like Ambani’s Diwali expenses.
Grievances took one look at my projected burn rate and caved, granting me the Infinia. But just as I got comfortable, HDFC pulled a fast one and launched the Infinia Reserve.
What followed was two years of absolute shit show, tripling my diaper budget just to meet the Reserve's minimum spend. I was burning cash faster than a tech startup. But after relentless swiping, I finally did it. HDFC bowed down and handed me the Reserve.
And that, my friends, is how I went from prenatal rejection to Reserve domination before even learning how to walk. AMA.",https://i.redd.it/hx5022w8zyme1.jpeg

[Please Read this before posting anything HDFC],"It's no surprise, HDFC is one of the biggest banks in India, if not the biggest. And every day, more and more people are either applying for HDFC Cards, or getting pre-approved offers as they have Salaried account, and we are getting REPEATED posts about the same topics, that makes it kind of difficult to get the right answers for newcomers.
Here's a complete guide, so please read this before posting anything.
Core vs Co-brand cards
The Core cards from HDFC are-
- Freedom
- Moneyback/+
- Millenia / DinersClub Millenia
- DinersClub Privilege 
- Regalia Gold 
- DinersClub Black Metal
- Infinia Metal
The Co-brand cards from HDFC are-
- Swiggy 
- Tata Neu
- Mariott Bonvoy 
- Indian Oil
- Indigo 6E
- IRCTC
And two more cards from HDFC within PayZapp that qualify as core cards for discounts are
- Pixel Play {split limit, not recommended unless first}
- Virtual RuPay
For self-employed or business people, these are also counted as core cards -
- Business Moneyback 
- Biz First
- Biz Grow
- Business Regalia
- BizPower
- BizBlack
There are a few older variants of cards which may or may not be discontinued for fresh applications.
- DinersClub Black (non metal, but many got LTF)
- Infinia (non metal - some users migrated already, but some are still having their old plastic infinia LTF. )
- TimesCard
What should be my first HDFC Card?
You should take one of the
core cards
from HDFC, as whatever co-brand card you take later, it will share the credit limit with your existing HDFC card.
If you take co-brand cards first, you may be able to apply for other co brand cards, and they will share the limit, but the bank would make it either super difficult for you to get a core card, or ask you to close existing co-brand cards before applying for a core card. We are recently seeing people getting freedom card from PayTM app even after holding co-brand cards, but then moving up the core card ladder may take some time and efforts.
The Pixel Play card is weird because it asks you to split your limit towards that card, and it's an irreversible reaction. (I have heard of people who got pixel play, not being able to tranfer back the limit to their OG core card even before/after closing pixel) (update- there seems to be an option to transfer a limit back, but I won't believe it till I see it)
Is my new card lifetime free?
If you apply from the website, you probably got the 'choose your card' page, and you were either shown the card you were looking for, or given a choice between three. In the bottom, in blue color ribbon, the card fees were mentioned, so take a screenshot of that while applying. If it says ""Life Time Free"", it means it IS free, and you won't be charged Joining fees or Annual/Renewal fees.
Alternatively, if you applied from from Swiggy or Tata Neu app, take screenshot of your LTF offer there.
Once you get the card, send a mail to customer care to confirm if the card issued to you is LTF. They will reply to you within a day mostly.
customerservices.cards[at]hdfcbank.com
First Year Free means that you WILL have to pay the Annual/Renewal fees for the card after the first year unless you meet the spend criteria. 
You can always email them and request for LTF conversion, but results may vary.
Is HDFC Swiggy Worth It?
YES
Absolutely, infact, it's better than Millenia especially with the rewards redemption fee.
I'll go ahead and say that it is worth it despite the fees if your usage aligns with it. If you get it LTF, go for it. Pounce on the offer/card
Why is Swiggy not LTF for me?
We don't know. You should just wait for a few months, you will get the LTF offer. Till then, you can get SBI Cashback and/or Airtel Axis and/or HSBC Live+
Which HDFC Card am I eligible for? Which cards can be offered via FD
A short while ago, this post was shared on the sub. It has the current eligibility criteria for the HDFC Card suite
https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/s/sZGbaKxl88
Refer to this above post to see the minimum limits, salary eligibility, government salary eligibility, ITR requirement and/or FD criteria (if available)
HDFC is not offering me Limit Increase/Enhancement
First check from your netbanking/app, and if you don't see an offer, Email their greviance redressal team. Usually HDFC rolls out LE offers between 20th-23rd of the month.
HDFC Card Upgrade
Same as above. Usually to move to DCBM or Infinia Metal is a tryst of its own, so tread with preparation. 
They may ask you to mail documents to their Chennai office, so you can either do this yourself or drop off documents at your nearest branch. They will mail it for you.
The other upgrades may be FYF Regalia Gold or FYF DCP from Millenia. These are also good, but choose according to use case.
One Line Review of the following cards from my side-
Core
Freedom
- Great to get your foot in the door for HDFC Core Cards ladder and get the sale discounts.
Moneyback
- Slightly better than freedom, still basic. Milestones easy to hit to get gift vouchers.
Millenia
- Good cashbacks but lower caps. Redemption fees are bad. Prefer Swiggy HDFC over this, keep this for core discounts offers. Again, good and easy to hit milestones and get gift vouchers.
DinersClub Millenia
- Same as Millenia, but on Diners Network. Poor acceptability.
DinersClub Privilege
- Great beginner card for lounge and movie benefits. Prefer if offered LTF over Millenia. Acceptance may be an issue. SmartBuy points make sense!
Regalia Gold
- Best beginner card for entering points and miles game. Amazing for lounge access. SmartBuy is super useful!{Atlas is better but costs twice and from a different bank}.
DinersClub Black Metal
- Almost Infinia. 9.9% on GCs, 16.6% on Flights, 33% on Hotels through SmartBuy. Unlimited Lounge and 6 Golf in a year! Some milestone benefits are good too. High annual fees.
Infinia Metal
- Apun ich bhagwaan hai.
Co Brand
Swiggy
- Great for those who didn't get SBI Cashback. Better than Millenia as cashback comes in statement directly.
Tata Neu Plus/Infinity
- Good ones. Infinity is better. Great for UPI if taken RuPay and spends in Tata ecosystem. Unconditional lounge access.
Mariott Bonvoy
- Great for Mariott Silver states, one night stay and lounge access.
Indian Oil
- good for fuel spends. RBL, SBI, Axis options should also be checked.
Indigo 6E
- weird as the rewards program is not yet integrated with the Blue Chip ecosystem. Still looks good to me. Check as per your use case.
IRCTC
- half decent. I've heard that there are too many cashback exclusions.
PayZapp
Pixel Play
- If you cannot get SBI Cashback, Millenia or Swiggy, then only look at this.
Virtual RuPay
- no. Unless you started with a co-brand card and desperately need a HDFC Core card for FK/AZ sales or instant discount offers.
Business Cards
BizFirst, BizGrow, Business Moneyback - Basic Starter cards. Good for instant discounts.
Business Regalia - Lounge was the only good perk, and even that has a spend criteria now. Won't recommend.
BizPower - This is good. But the rewards accelerator kicks in at 20k spends a month. Risky if you don't have fixed expenses. If you do, you can get good rewards! Great for tax payments.
BizBlack - Also great card. Especially alongside infinia. The reward rate is mind-blowing. Do note that this also has same issue as above, where you need X amount of spends for the rewards to kick in. The redemption is also through NetBanking.
FD Based Cards?
Core Cards up to Regalia Gold have options to be isused against FD.
Someone posted a screenshot of spreadsheet, I'll either link the post or screenshot here when I find it. It also contains eligibility criteria.

I have been trying to get a credit card for 5 months now. I have a savings account in hdfc which I started using as my salary account. Then started the never-ending calls and WhatsApp Messages from random employees of hdfc. In the beginning I would apply through them, provide them payslips, did KYC (during which they randomly visited my home twice without any prior information), yet my applications would always get declined. There was absolutely no communication from the bank's end as well, just a mail saying that my credit card application got declined as they have received prior applications from me which they were still processing. Any normal person would contact the customer care of the bank, or rather visit the bank itself, but me being the lazy bum I am, I decided to just give up.
Then came a promotional mail from ICICI Bank - in which they were offering ICICI Sapphiro Credit Card to alumnis of Tier 1/Premium Institutions of India. Generally I delete these mails, but out of desperation I filled out the form. The next day I received a call from a sales representative. I completed the KYC, uploaded my degree and voila! My card got approved in 2 days and received it the next day!
Credit limit: 300000 INR (cumulative)
Also received the Priority Pass Membership Card which offers 2 complimentary lounge accesses at select airports.
Anyway, thanks for reading this till here. And if you're new to the corporate world and waiting for your first credit card, don't lose hope! And if nothing works, maybe try getting into an IIT 😉

So here's the story.
I requested for closure of my Amazon Pay ICICI CC on 20th January, 2024. ICICI replied saying that the card has been closed on 21st January, 2024.
I kept that email with me and destroyed the card and moved on with life.
Jump to September 2024, I opted to take the Cibil yearly subscription just to see what the report contains and the benefits of it. Once, I saw the report,  I realized that my Amazon Pay CC is still active as per my CIBIL report.
Took this up with ICICI at all levels, but they just kept diverting from the issue and wouldn't even address the problem at hand. Typical bank behavior. Next step, complained to RBI Ombudsman. I read on this subreddit that we are entitled to a compensation of Rs. 500/- per day if the card is not closed beyond 7 days from request of closure.
RBI took 2 months to solve the issue. I tried to seek a compensation of 500 per day for over 200 days from Jan till September, but ICICI again said that the card is cancelled but they didn't update the same with Credit bureau. Finally, got compensated for this failure at 100 per day for 142 days. Since the rule kicks in only from April 26, 2024, so from that date till 13th September 2024.
Have a nice day. Feel free to shoot any questions.

We were flying from Hyderabad today and went to the lounge. We both have Priority Pass and were trying to get into the lounge. I just casually observed a newly married couple with whom I think were the parents of the bride. The husband had some credit card and wanted to take his wife inside but I think his card only allowed one person. He tried asking the reception and the reception was rude telling him that it is 2500 person. So the wife’s parents and the wife told him not to buy and they don’t need to eat. The wife kept convincing the husband to go inside and she that was ok. Me and my brother found this super cute.
we both added a guest on our priority pass and surprised the couple by giving the passes to them. For the third person I used my Amex platinum and they charged 2 rupees. I bought all of them in the priority line and let them in. They were so happy especially the husband and kept thanking us.
Be good do good. Cheers.
Edit : Some people are bashing in comments and apparently they need a clarification. My Priority pass is with Amex India Platinum and my brothers is with Chase Sapphire reserve US which are both premium cards and allow free guests. Check with your card terms before using.",

Thanks to the
r/creditcardsIndia
community for the motivation and advice! I redeemed two years' worth of Amex Platinum travel credit card Taj vouchers (₹20k total) plus Tata Neu points to enjoy a heavily discounted one-night stay at Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai, including a sea-view room and birthday perks. Sharing my strategy and experience for anyone looking to maximize credit card rewards for luxury stays.
---
First, a big thank you to this community for all the insights and motivation you’ve given me on my credit card journey. Your advice inspired me to explore and optimize my rewards better.
I recently redeemed a heavily discounted one-night stay at the iconic Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai, and wanted to share my experience and how I achieved it.
How I did it:
Mainly through the Amex Platinum travel credit card. Over two years, I accumulated Taj vouchers worth ₹20,000 (₹10k each year), which are awarded after spending ₹4L within the membership year.
I also used two Tata Neu cards (Tata Neu Plus from HDFC and Tata Neu Infinity from SBI). These helped me accumulate about 4500 Neu points, which I redeemed during the stay.
My strategy:
I spent the ₹4L slowly in year 1 and quickly in year 2, thanks to insurance payments and travel bookings early in the second year. This gave me two overlapping Taj vouchers (one expiring Aug 2025, the other May 2026), which I combined for the stay.
I maximized daily shopping within the Tata ecosystem using Tata Neu cards, especially on Big Basket, which was my biggest source of Neu coins. The Tata Neu Infinity card gave me 7% cashback.
The stay:
It was near my birthday, and Taj made it special with a beautiful bouquet lasting over a week and Forest Essentials gift boxes worth ₹4k. Always use occasions like birthdays or anniversaries to get extra perks.
I booked the Taj Mahal Tower sea-view room (standard rates only, as Amex vouchers can’t be used on member rates even if you have Taj Epicure membership). Calling the reservation team to confirm voucher redemption is a must.
The sea-view room was worth the extra cost — stunning views of the Arabian Sea, Gateway of India, and Taj Mahal Palace domes from a lovely balcony on a higher floor.
Cost comparison for weekend stay (including breakfast & taxes):
Hotel
City View (₹)
Sea View (₹)
Taj Mahal Palace
29,500
35,400
Taj Mahal Tower
19,470
24,190
Instead of a Saturday check in & Sunday check out, we chose Sunday check-in and Monday check-out, which was about ₹2,000 cheaper.
Additional experiences:
Since the Taj Mahal Palace stay was too expensive, we enjoyed High Tea at the Sea Lounge restaurant there for about ₹3,200+tax per person. It included a buffet but no alcohol. I redeemed 4500 Tata Neu points and paid the rest with Tata Neu Infinity card, earning 5% points back.
A highlight was the free Taj Heritage tour, led by a staff member with 40+ years of service. It’s highly recommended and must be booked through the hotel staff as it fills up quickly.
Overall, this stay was a memorable experience combining smart credit card usage, loyalty points, and special occasion perks. I hope this helps others looking to maximize their credit card rewards for luxury stays!

CreditCardsIndia,https://old.reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1gyq4ln/avoid_credit_cards_till_absolutely_necessary/,1297,307,Avoid Credit Cards till absolutely necessary !!!,"Hi friends,
I am an ex-banker and currently practice as an Advocate in India. Most redditors come to this sub asking for advice on CCs, which one is good etc. Here are some stark truths which no Card Issuing bank or company will tell you:
A credit card is just like another loan
. It is a clean loan (that is there is no security like a house or car hypothecated to the issuer.
No card is good for anybody.  -
It is best to avoid a credit card till it becomes absolutely necessary because of frequent travel, stay at hotels etc.  If your company makes you take a CC ask them to get you a Corporate card, which they will settle on their own.
Card schemes are attractive-
All card issuers entice people using reward points and frequent offers on the card- these are temporary and can be withdrawn any time.
Payments to Card
-
PAY TOTAL AMOUNT DUE EVERY TIME
- If you carry forward by paying Minimum Amount Due (MAD), then the acronym sums it up- you are mad and getting trapped into revolving debt Every purchase you make gets added to the Total Amt due and interest @ 36 % p.a. and above is calculated on not only the earlier amount lying to your debit but also new amounts .
Credit SCORE. -
Dont go for a CC only to get your credit score - Say you want to buy a bike or car on loan at a later date, your loan approving bank will waive CIBIL score requirement (if there is none against your PAN upon search). Once you pay the EMIs on time, your CIBIL score will automatically go up.
Monitor your SMS/ Card statements
and dispute any txn which is not yours. Onus is on you to dispute. one of my previous bank's customers diligently saw debits for medical insurance to his credit card and when the bank failed to address this issue, he sued and got Rs. 5 lacs in compensation !
Dont go for BNPL or conversion of purchases into EMIs on CC
- all these are traps - nothing comes free. If you have cash, buy the product, else forget about it. If you want iphone, do with Nothing 2A - ultimately  you are the master of your cash flows. If you cant buy Nothing 2A, go for a dumb phone and buy smartphone later. !!

sent to you periodically or go to the card website and read their T&Cs carefully
If you dont want a card-
refuse it in first instance. If they send you a card still, keep monitoring the SoA -
charges debited like annual charges etc. add up fast- if you are not keeping a hawk's eye then it is your problem !
If you fall into a problem of repayment
, DONT borrow another loan to repay the CC outstanding. beg from family or friends and pay off FULLY and get the damn card CLOSED not SETTLED.
Friends, I have been in this business for close to 30 years as a Banker, now as an advocate and have handled close to 2200 odd cases as an arbitrator. To all young redditors, this is the soundest advice I can give.
Also remember the old American Saying ""There is nothing called a free lunch"".

I had applied for the Federal Bank's Scapia in May and received their ""way too generic"" rejection email.
I wrote to them quoting the RBI circular asking them for the actual reason for rejection & they started playing dodge-ball!
I complained to RBI in June and after 3-4 months of back & forth (which included them actually giving my the Card and still being non-committal regarding the reason), they folded and approved ₹10,000 as compensation for their mess-up.
This is my second win against a Bank denying my application for wrongful/unclear reasons. Getting this compensation for an LTF card is a unique case of irony resulting in a Happy Ending (for me atleast)!",https://i.redd.it/exxn1bxayz3g1.png

I wanted to share my recent experience with
HDFC Bank's misleading credit card sales tactics
and how I got
₹10,000 in compensation
after filing a complaint with the
RBI Ombudsman
. If you've faced similar issues, this might help you take action!
What Happened?
I applied for an
HDFC Tata Neu Infinity Credit Card
through a sales representative.
Instead, they
issued an IOCL Credit Card without my consent
.
When I raised the issue, their sales team and manager
misled me into reapplying multiple times
,
assuring me of approval
despite knowing my application would be rejected.
Every rejection caused
multiple hard inquiries on my credit report
, affecting my credit score.
How I Took Action
Raised multiple complaints with
HDFC Bank
When they
failed to resolve the issue
, I filed a complaint on the
RBI CMS portal
RBI
investigated the case
, found HDFC at fault for
not informing me of the rejection reason
, and directed them to compensate me.
The Outcome
RBI ordered
HDFC to credit ₹10,000 as compensation
for their deficiency in service.
The amount was credited to my account on
March 13, 2025
.
Here’s the
official response from RBI
along with a
screenshot of the credited amount
(attached).
Lessons & Takeaways
💡
Banks often get away with mis-selling and unethical practices, but you CAN fight back!
💡
RBI’s Ombudsman process works if you have a valid case.
💡
Never let banks manipulate you into reapplying without clear reasons.
If anyone else has faced
credit card mis-selling
or
unethical banking practices
, I highly recommend filing a complaint via the
RBI CMS portal
.
Would love to hear your thoughts - has anyone else successfully taken action against such practices?

Filed a complaint with the CP Grams portal.
In July 2024, I requested closure of my ICICI credit card ending in 2009. They said it was closed. But for 8+ months, the account showed as active on my credit report.
Turns out, ICICI clubbed 3 credit cards under one account (which I was never explicitly told), and used that as a technical excuse to keep the whole account active. Even after I closed one card, they kept the account running, citing a ₹0.55 excess balance that they never told me about until March 2025. I had a coral card which I closed in July 2024 and Rubyx dual variant LTF cards that I closed in November 2024. ICICI claims that when I closed the coral card, I should've also closed the other cards for my account to close. Some stupid shit they pull out in name of technicalities.
Under RBI rules, failure to close a credit card within 7 days entitles the customer to ₹500/day compensation. Non-reporting to credit bureaus is ₹100/day, and this case involves both.
I raised a complaint with the RBI Ombudsman in April 2025. That’s when ICICI started scrambling:
First, they quietly offered ₹9,600 as compensation.
Then in their official RBI response, they changed it to ₹12,300.
And finally, without my consent, and while the case is still pending, they credited ₹25,900 to my account on May 30, 2025.
I’ve categorically rejected this amount in writing to both ICICI and the RBI Ombudsman. I’ve asked for the ₹500/day compensation (₹1,16,500) as per RBI guidelines, and I’m not even claiming the ₹100/day part out of goodwill.
If ICICI refuses, I’m ready to take this to court. I’ve submitted all proofs to the RBI.
Is there anything more I can do?",

Never thought I'd pull this off!,"I have been very thankful to the golden era of Axis Magnus when we got 25,000 edge rewards for 1 lakh spends a month. Last year, I took my family of 5 to Europe and saved about 6 lakhs on hotel stays.
And now, while I never imagined I’d be able to fly business class from the US to India for free, but here we are.
When I first started getting excited about travel in my late 20s, this kind of thing felt far off. I’d always hoped to fly business one day on international long-hauls, but getting a $4,000+ ticket without paying for it wasn’t something I thought I could pull off.
Recently took the United nonstop flight from Newark EWR to Delhi DEL. I used 100k United miles + $10 in taxes. These were miles I had transferred a couple of years ago from Magnus. I had stacked up a bunch of points back then and moved a good chunk to United and as many to Accor.
A couple of years ago, those same United miles helped me book a one-way ticket for my wife for just 50k miles and made it way easier for her to come with me on a US work trip where the return leg was crazy expensive.
Funny thing: when I searched for this flight, it initially showed 230k miles. But when I accidentally clicked it on the United desktop site, it dropped to 100k. This weird pricing glitch only shows up on the website, not the app and apparently this happens with a lot of fares. Felt lucky and just booked it, even before my work trip was finalised.
One of the best things about United is how flexible they are with miles. You can cancel till the very end and get all your points and taxes back. No questions. Super easy to change dates too. Honestly, their miles program and app deserves its own post.
This was my first international business class flight. And yeah, going back to economy is going to be hard, especially for flights longer than 8 hours. Got real sleep, had great food three to four times, pajamas, slippers, even had someone come and take my coat at takeoff which felt wild. The peace and quiet of the business class cabin is something else!
And the United sundae cart: I get why people love it so much now.
At the time of my booking this was selling for about $3800 one way. Would I pay full price for this? Probably not. But I’m really grateful that credit cards and points make things like this possible. And also really thankful for this community - so many of you have helped me figure things out along the way.
Hope we all get to do more of these.","['https://preview.redd.it/rkxmjs2cl26f1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=524fa6f91a9c31c6db6fb250491098fc4178f2cf', 'https://preview.redd.it/9mk8pq2cl26f1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=075b5f3c8e7adfd29464966d60dac6f5c1602099', 'https://preview.redd.it/avimlr2cl26f1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=92628f405ba3dd6cc58697f3e3ff729605a725d8', 'https://preview.redd.it/nkwdss2cl26f1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=849c7f954286395d49129750448472e3dc550179', 'https://preview.redd.it/foubcu2cl26f1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=f60e334e3719b6d86b24c71b29c6724a085a42d5', 'https://preview.redd.it/m9v7lu2cl26f1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=73efc46a5da1abf02755c11541ac1fd10b05843a', 'https://preview.redd.it/yeyd8s2cl26f1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=c92e996b3827bf9641a021721feb6b8d6f4d0df1', 'https://preview.redd.it/oo14v43cl26f1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=66315a635a3bded45c03702b7082bc72427de120', 'https://preview.redd.it/0ev0163cl26f1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=357d9100094460ad0063508d713c7f5fd6279276', 'https://preview.redd.it/54d4c33cl26f1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=749abcd49bf21665016424ff03314a7ae8b49921']"

Laddu Tabrez
first refused to leave my iMac with security on a Saturday, then returned on a weekday, heckled my entire team while we were on deadline, and refused to deliver the device. When I confronted him, he told me harshly to ""forget about it.""
My team's on a tight deadline and desperately needed a new iMac, which Amazon has now failed to deliver twice because of the truly bizarre and hostile actions of one delivery guy. The first attempt was last Saturday. I wasn't in the office, but we have security staff available for package acceptance. This guy flat out refused to leave the high-value item with them, creating a large, unnecessary disturbance with his unprofessional loudness before marking the item as ""undeliverable."" This initial refusal immediately put me behind schedule and forced me to re-order the critical equipment.
I quickly placed the second order, hoping to salvage my week, only to be horrified when the exact same guy showed up. He immediately started his routine again, making a huge ruckus being loud, harassing, and generally disruptive. His actions took unnecessary liberty, severely disturbing both my entire team, who were on a tight deadline, and the office staff too. I had to stop working and personally confront him about the delivery, explaining the urgency and the fact that this was the second attempt caused by his previous non-delivery.
His response was simply shocking. He maintained a harsh, and utterly unprofessional tone and told me directly to ""forget about it"" ""Bhool jao, nahi milega"". He then refused to hand over the iMac and promptly left. I'm now facing serious delays in my business operations and team productivity, all due to the targeted malice and staggering unprofessionalism of one delivery agent. I’ve reported this to Amazon, but the idea of re-ordering a third time with the risk of him showing up again is stressing me out. Does anyone have advice on how to force Amazon to handle this targeted harassment and finally get my essential equipment?
EDIT: Left out a crucial detail, the order was marked ""Returned"" and I had not idea when/ how this happened because I never refused delivery. All this violence BS happened when I called the delivery agent's number from the Amazon-order tracking portal, and the guy who came was apparently his brother or whatever. This guy has never even stepped foot near my office to deliver the thing. And we've filed a police complaint against this miscreant. Hoping for justice soon.",https://i.redd.it/yhzfd960kj7g1.png

And when he started an experiment with lemon cultivation in the land of wheat and rice people were even more surprised.
In an exclusive interview with Startup Pedia, Mishra shared his journey from being a usual serviceman to becoming the ‘Lemon Man’ of Uttar Pradesh.
Initially, he cultivated the two staple crops, wheat and paddy but soon realized why farmers were unhappy. One hectare of field yielded an annual profit of only ₹ 52,000.
Meeting officials at the District Agriculture Office one fine morning suddenly brought him the idea of lemon cultivation. However, he was clueless at the start as no one could give him the information he needed as before him no one tried cultivating lemons.
Gradually, he started reaping the fruits of his labor. His lemon production flourished and money started pouring in. People in Raebareli as well as throughout Uttar Pradesh fondly started calling him the ‘Lemon Man.’
Today, Lemon Man Anand Mishra is not just a farmer. With an annual turnover of fifteen lakhs, he is a horticulture expert, trainer, and corporate consultant.
When asked if this horticulture business is profitable, Lemon Man confidently replied it sure is. “For lemon cultivation, a farmer can make 2 - 5 Lakhs from 1 acre of land from the 4th year while for traditional it would be only 30-35K annually.”
On asking about the biggest challenge one faces while cultivating lemons, Mishra revealed it was the unavailability of insurance. “Horticulture has no insurance although we are taking huge risks,” Lemon Man laments.
Anand Mishra is confident that anyone can do lemon cultivation.

It's been 14 months and the vision is great but due to internal issues, we are shutting it down. 
Here are my learnings that I hope will help group members here. 
1. Pick your cofounders like you pick your spouse
2. Unresolved conflicts will kill the startup faster than competition 
3. Leadership isn't about titles but it's about action
4. Don't let one person hijack the company direction. Doesn't matter how senior he is
5. Be wary if your cofounder overstates or misleads investors
6. Never rely on verbal agreements 
7. Ensure legal and financial transparency from day one
8. Don't ignore red flags in your co founders. You may think you can work around it but don't even try 
9. Keep a clear paper trail. 
10. Don't work with anyone who lacks integrity.
It's been hard shutting it down after so much of blood and sweat but I have to accept the reality of the situation.
Taking a break now and then back to it again. Job or another startup.. let's see.",

Their journey began when Praveen, while pursuing his MTech, read about indoor saffron farming. After training in Thailand and visiting Pampore, Kashmir, they decided to cultivate saffron at home.
In 2018, they converted an unused room on their roof for this purpose, using aeroponics—a method that allows plants to grow in air or mist without soil.
They invested around ₹6 lakh to set up the lab, purchasing saffron bulbs from Kashmir. Despite initial setbacks with damaged seeds, they persevered and successfully harvested 2 kg of saffron in one season, earning ₹10 lakh.
The brothers carefully manage the growing conditions with temperature control, humidity, and grow lights.
They plant saffron bulbs in August and harvest the flowers in November. After harvesting, they can use the bulbs again for future planting, reducing costs significantly.
Their brand, Amaratva, not only caters to the domestic market but also exports to countries like the US and UK. By diversifying their farming with mushrooms during off-seasons, they continue to increase their earnings.",https://i.redd.it/u77zzbfibhwd1.jpeg

At first, I was just sitting on the first floor.
He walked in and said:
“Bro, this is too cramped. Let’s go to the top floor, it’s more comfortable.”
So we went upstairs, ordered food, and started talking.
He was breaking down how VCs think, how to pitch, why storytelling matters, how clarity in your head has to translate into clarity in your pitch.
Honestly, I was just soaking it all in.
While he was talking, I noticed a group of people walk into the private room right in front of us.
From the corner of my eye, I realised:
“F***. That’s Nikhil Kamath sitting there.”
I didn’t want to interrupt because his advice was gold.
But the moment he paused, he also noticed:
“Bro, Nikhil Kamath is sitting there!”
We were both starstruck.
Then he asked me:
“Do you have any business material on you?”
Me: “No card, nothing.”
Then I remembered: “Wait, I have my diary.”
He didn’t even think twice:
“Do it right now. You have to take all the chances you get.”
So I pulled out my diary, scribbled a quick handwritten note about what I’m building (BeHooked), tore the page, and folded it neatly.
We were lucky our table was right in front of the door to that room. Otherwise, this moment would never have happened.
I didn’t want to interrupt his group, so I asked the waiter to pass it along. The staff was super nice, they delivered it to him.
And then Nikhil read it carefully. He looked up, smiled, and waved at me.
That 2-second wave made the entire day worth it.
If we hadn’t moved to the top floor, none of this would have happened.
Take your shots. You never know which one will land.
I really think this could turn into something. Let’s hope for the best.

If India was as strong as China militarily, economically Pakistan wouldn't even have dared to pull off a terror attack. USA wouldn't have the power to pressure India into a ceasefire. India could have choked Pakistan without firing a shot. Also, our ministers and spokespersons would not have the necessity to go on to international media to gain advantage over Pakistan in information battle. Forget setting international narratives right, our own people were getting information from twitter, reddit, YouTube and whatnot (none of them Indian) the government had to go and reach out to the platforms to block certain content and accounts from spreading misinformation. India definitely needs a social platform, if not international at least national, like Chinese. It's a shame that our local city governing bodies had to buy twitter premium and issues alerts and pass on info to its own citizens through these networks, where do you think USA gets its intelligence for its agencies from? (facebook, instagram, x, google, apple, android, windows, etc etc)
Despite all the work in diplomacy by our foreign minister from the past decade, we had no real powers rallying behind us for justice against terrorism, no sanctions or any serious repercussions against Pakistan (the IMF loan in the middle was a serious blow), It just shows how we are left for ourselves to defend our lands, tomorrow if China comes in and tries anything in India, the world won't speak a word, they have all the rare earth metals yk.
The S400 systems that we all hail and praise, were built and tested by Russia in 1999, in 1999!!!!!, 26 years later, so many batches of IITians later and PHDs who went and researched in top tech in the west later, we have nothing remotely close to it, Even Iran has home built superior air defense systems and hypersonic missiles(used against us yesterday) despite under deep western sanctions, don't even talk about fighter jets, we just spend billions and buy whatever is available, despite knowing, export variations of the jets from any country are inferior to their own home jets. We know full well that countries can and will withhold weapons in a time of need for India. In the event of war, if Russia, USA or France for that matter decide to not sell any weapons/defense for us, we are truly f**ed.
I have huge respect for our army. 80 Billon Dollars(6 lack 80 thousand CRORE rupees!) is our Defense spending. why are there not a lot of startups building things for the Army? why does it always have to be DRDO, that does the military research? Are we not dreaming big enough? My work and company is no less important than yours and your contribution for the country, but there definitely is a lot of nobility and sense of pride when building for our nation and her security.

My understanding is that the globalisation era needed social media for people to connect worldwide, share connections cultures and form communities across. Ofcourse dating and sex have always been hidden driving force behind every internet sensation and will continue to do so. Then there are social hierarchies, sense of identity and belonging. Whoever is building the next platform needs to think of all these factors that contributed to the growth of these apps that exist today.",

I mentioned to her a buddy of mine who just launched a soap startup for people with sensitive skin and I asked her, “Would you invest in something like that?”
She immediately said no, not because the product was bad or the founder wasn’t capable. Her reason was simple and it was: The product doesn’t get better with more people use it.
She explained that great startup ideas usually have some built-in compounding advantage (in terms of product feature, not cost). Something that makes the product stronger, or smarter as more people use it.
Soap doesn’t do that. You sell it, that’s it, it doesn’t improve with use or unlock new value at scale.
The problem is when founders take VC money to sell cheap and grow fast, but later investors want profits. So prices go up. Then a new startup comes in with fresh funding and undercuts them. Rinse and repeat. Especially in markets like India, where anyone can white-label a similar product and compete on price.
Her advice was clear and honest, it’s one of the simplest yet powerful mental models I’ve heard on judging startup ideas:
If your product doesn’t get better with more users, think twice before treating it like a startup. Maybe it’s just a solid business. And that’s perfectly okay.",

Then you’ve got senior engineers, mostly ex-IIT or NIT. No offense, but I’ve yet to meet one who didn’t flex their college badge within two minutes of conversation. That’s not an achievement, that’s arrested development.
Their entire personality revolves around a college entrance exam they cracked a decade ago. And because of that, they walk around with the delusion that anyone from a “lesser” college is intellectually inferior. The arrogance is unbearable, and it trickles down into the work culture rigid, toxic, and elitist.
Take Ola, Zepto, or Zomato, pick your poison. A guy working at Ola’s AI wing literally killed himself from the pressure. Zomato canned over 300 employees for the crime of being slightly late. Not after warnings, not after reviews just out. No empathy, no support. It’s not just mismanagement. It’s inhumane.

This news about a 17-year-old boy from UP making a robot went viral, and suddenly every wannabe intellectual on social media started trolling him, saying it’s just a mannequin and questioning why the media is hyping it.
Well, no one was hyping it. No one said the boy made something on the level of Unitree’s humanoid robots. The point was that he was a below-middle-class boy from a village, studying in a simple school, and he still made that robot without any resources or formal training. He was completely self-taught.
Sure, it had no commercial use. But should kids only build something if it has commercial value? If a multibillion-dollar company made it and tried to sell it, the reaction would have been justified. But he wasn’t trying to sell it or anything.
Do you even know what your act of clowning on that boy and his robot does? It sends a message to millions of Indian children who are active on social media that if they create something that’s not state-of-the-art, people will troll them and laugh at them. It tells them that making things isn’t cool but roasting people who make imperfect things is what’s considered cool.
Why did the media cover this?
So you’re okay with the media covering fraud babas all day, but you have a problem when they cover a village boy’s rough, homemade project that could inspire many others like him? Even for that boy, a bit of encouragement might have pushed him to pursue higher studies in robotics or even start a robotics company in the future.
Something similar happened to a Karnataka boy who made a rough prototype of a drone taxi .People on the internet clowned on him too.

The poses, the lighting, the random vacation-style smiling family… it’s like my old Google Photos library got reincarnated as a model weight.
Like let’s be real:
Google collected billions of ultra-high-quality images for over a decade, neatly labeled with dates, faces, locations, context, even automatic tags. We all happily fed it our pets, sunsets, food pics, wedding albums, baby photos, memes… and Google said: “Thanks, we’ll improve Search ☺️”.
Fast forward to 2024–2025 and suddenly Google’s image generation is skipping ahead like it has the entire world’s photo history as a training ground.
But of course, they’ll never admit it.
Terms & Conditions? “We do not use your photos for advertising.”
Cool, but AI training isn’t advertising.
Deep down we all know what happened…
but we just can’t prove it.

The point was that he was a below-middle-class boy from a village, studying in a simple school, and he still made that robot without any resources or formal training. He was completely self-taught.
Sure, it had no commercial use. But should kids only build something if it has commercial value? If a multibillion-dollar company made it and tried to sell it, the reaction would have been justified. But he wasn’t trying to sell it or anything.
Do you even know what your act of clowning on that boy and his robot does? It sends a message to millions of Indian children who are active on social media that if they create something that’s not state-of-the-art, people will troll them and laugh at them. It tells them that making things isn’t cool but roasting people who make imperfect things is what’s considered cool.
Why did the media cover this?
So you’re okay with the media covering fraud babas all day, but you have a problem when they cover a village boy’s rough, homemade project that could inspire many others like him? Even for that boy, a bit of encouragement might have pushed him to pursue higher studies in robotics or even start a robotics company in the future.
Something similar happened to a Karnataka boy who made a rough prototype of a drone taxi .People on the internet clowned on him too.

The poses, the lighting, the random vacation-style smiling family… it’s like my old Google Photos library got reincarnated as a model weight.
Like let’s be real:
Google collected billions of ultra-high-quality images for over a decade, neatly labeled with dates, faces, locations, context, even automatic tags. We all happily fed it our pets, sunsets, food pics, wedding albums, baby photos, memes… and Google said: “Thanks, we’ll improve Search ☺️”.
Fast forward to 2024–2025 and suddenly Google’s image generation is skipping ahead like it has the entire world’s photo history as a training ground.
But of course, they’ll never admit it.
Terms & Conditions? “We do not use your photos for advertising.”
Cool, but AI training isn’t advertising.
Deep down we all know what happened…
but we just can’t prove it.
