crypto,https://old.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/5cz1fz/wikileaks_latest_insurance_files_dont_match_hashes/,4327,1193,Wikileaks latest insurance files don't match hashes,"UPDATE: @Wikileaks has made a statement regarding the discrepancy.
https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/798997378552299521
NOTE: When we release pre-commitment hashes they are for decrypted files (obviously). Mr. Assange appreciates the concern.
The statement confirms that the pre-commits are in fact, for the latest insurance files. As the links above show, Wikileaks has historically used hashes for encrypted files (since 2010). Therefore, the intention of the pre-commitment hashes is not ""obvious"". Using a hash for a decrypted file could put readers in danger as it forces them to open a potentially malicious file in order to verify if its contents are real. Generating hashes from encrypted files is standard, practical and safe. I recommend waiting for a PGP signed message from Wikileaks before proceeding with further communication.
The latest insurance files posted by Wikileaks do not match the pre-commitment hashes they tweeted in October.

You can request to be approved via the reddit website.
Edit: send a request via modmail here:
https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/crypto
You MUST provide a reason for why you want to join, since we also get spam bots sending such requests, and we can't tell you apart from them unless you write something in the request.
We can also suggest
/r/cryptography
, as they are currently open (as they do not face the same volume of spam as we do).
Due to reddit's incredibly meager moderation tools, this may have to stay this way until reddit finally improves the tools for dealing with bots.
Due to a recent extreme spike in spam volume, this subreddit is becoming nearly impossible to moderate properly, as it is becoming hard to find the legitimate submissions and comments in the middle of the spam.
Due to this I am temporarily making a change which will only allow users approved in advance by us mods to contribute.
New and intermittent users who needs to get such an approval to be able to post can
send a mod mail to us by sending a PM addressed at /r/crypto
, and once you get confirmation you will be able to make your submissions.
To get approved, AT LEAST ONE criteria below MUST be met by you / your account. You should;
provide a reason for why you want to be approved in our subreddit, to be sent to us when you make the request. For example, if you want to post a question then share a summary of it.
have recent ORIGINAL high quality contributions (posts or comments), showing your account is likely genuine (distinguishing it from a spam farm account)
have a long lived account with good reputation (no requirement of frequent activity, just showing you will follow the rules)
have a history of high quality contributions (again, showing you understand and will follow the rules) in this subreddit or in related subreddits / communities
If you make a request from an account with a post history which is empty or which doesn't look original, and you also don't provide a reason for why you want to join, then we might reject your request. We moderators reserve the right to approve our deny requests as we see fit.
We want to keep this subreddit open for beginners as well, as it has been up until now, so if you have a valid on-topic question or other content then don't hesitate to make the request and to inform us of why.
Note:
If you are already subscribed, or
if you previously have received a personal message via this subreddit about being a trusted contributor, then you do not need to request approval to be able to comment.
Posting does seem to require separate rights, your account has to be set as a trusted contributor by us mods.
Note: if the button for making posts is visible as normal to you on the website, with no restrictions visible if you click it, then it means you already have posting rights.",

Someone asked why he has not sent a PGP signed message. He answered:
There’s a lot of people not very informed about computer security making claims. PGP keys don’t prove anything, except that the person who has control over the key has control over the key.
If the question is does someone using a Wikileaks PGP key say anything at all - well it says that that person has control over the key. Nothing else. A concern that most people – well some people – is that because of my lack of visibility Wikileaks has been taken over by [unintelligible-… etc etc] which is false.
[ says it’s an understandable concern because similar things has happened in the past, elaborates on an example. ]
In the case of the PGP keys all they do is say that whoever controls the key controls the key.
How correct does this logic behind dismissing of the PGP encryption program seem?

In order to make the subreddit moderation more responsive we moderators have looked into using various automation tools, and eventually decided that the performance of ChatGPT for determining what's following the subreddit rules or not is now sufficient for real world deployment.
We asked the ChatGPT bot to introduce itself, so here's it's message to the subreddit;
Dear Cryptography Forum Members,
I am honored to introduce myself as your newly appointed moderator. As someone with a passion for cryptography, I am excited to take on this role and help foster a thriving community for all of us to learn, share knowledge, and engage in thoughtful discussions.
As moderator, my primary goal is to ensure that our forum remains a safe and respectful space for all members. I will be monitoring posts and comments to ensure that they adhere to our community guidelines and encourage constructive dialogue. I will also be available to answer any questions or concerns you may have about the forum, its rules, or any cryptography-related topics.
In addition to maintaining a positive community atmosphere, I also plan to introduce new initiatives and activities to keep our forum engaging and informative. I am eager to hear your suggestions and ideas, and I look forward to working with you all to make this forum an even better resource for anyone interested in cryptography.
Thank you for the opportunity to serve as your moderator, and I look forward to getting to know you all better as we explore the fascinating world of cryptography together.
Sincerely,
[Your Name]
