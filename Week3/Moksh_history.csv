I found it rummaging through my in-law's basement this past weekend and wanted to share what I perceived to be a good primary source of history with the community. In light of the ""on all sides"" rhetoric I found this to be a poignant reminder of how people on opposing sides (literally, Hitler) could come together.
I never had a chance to meet Pop, but from what I'm told he was a gentleman and a scholar who was even more popular with the ladies than he was with the Nazis.
Here is the book:

*Edit: Many of you have asked about what type of person ""Pop"" was so I wanted to share some anecdotes from his granddaughter (my fiance):
He deeply cared about the happiness of other people and always put them before himself.
He was a Lifemaster of Bridge.
He loved getting mail so much he would sign up for mailers and then gave the gifts away.
He was always honest and told you exactly how he felt, but was nice about it.
He constantly made new friends throughout his life and was a popular gentleman.
He died in 2004 at the age of 83 after a long battle with cancer.",

Children began to be the tyrants, not the slaves, of their households.

paraphrasing of Hellenic attitudes towards the youth in 600 - 300 BC
“[Young people] are high-minded because they have not yet been humbled by life, nor have they experienced the force of circumstances.
...
They think they know everything, and are always quite sure about it.”
Rhetoric, Aristotle

In all things I yearn for the past. Modern fashions seem to keep on growing more and more debased. I find that even among the splendid pieces of furniture built by our master cabinetmakers, those in the old forms are the most pleasing. And as for writing letters, surviving scraps from the past reveal how superb the phrasing used to be. The ordinary spoken language has also steadily coarsened. People used to say
""raise the carriage shafts""
or
""trim the lamp wick,""
but people today say
""raise it""
or
""trim it.""
When they should say,
""Let the men of the palace staff stand forth!""
they say,
""Torches! Let's have some light!""
Instead of calling the place where the lectures on the Sutra of the Golden Light are delivered before the emperor

“Whither are the manly vigour and athletic appearance of our forefathers flown? Can these be their legitimate heirs? Surely, no; a race of effeminate, self-admiring, emaciated fribbles can never have descended in a direct line from the heroes of Potiers and Agincourt...”
Letter in Town and Country magazine republished in Paris Fashion: A Cultural History
1771
The total neglect of this art [speaking] has been productive of the worst consequences...in the conduct of all affairs ecclesiastical and civil, in church, in parliament, courts of justice...the wretched state of elocution is apparent to persons of any discernment and taste… if something is not done to stop this growing evil …English is  likely to become a mere jargon, which every one may pronounce as he pleases.
A General Dictionary of the English Language, Thomas Sheridan
1780
The free access which many young people have to romances, novels, and plays has poisoned the mind and corrupted the morals of many a promising youth; and prevented others from improving their minds in useful knowledge. Parents take care to feed their children with wholesome diet; and yet how unconcerned about the provision for the mind, whether they are furnished with salutary food, or with trash, chaff, or poison?
Memoirs of the Bloomsgrove Family, Reverend Enos Hitchcock
1790
We remarked with pain that the indecent foreign dance called the Waltz was introduced (we believe for the first time) at the English court on Friday last … it is quite sufficient to cast one's eyes on the voluptuous intertwining of the limbs and close compressor on the bodies in their dance, to see that it is indeed far removed from the modest reserve which has hitherto been considered distinctive of English females. So long as this obscene display was confined to prostitutes and adulteresses, we did not think it deserving of notice; but now that it is attempted to be forced on the respectable classes of society by the civil examples of their superiors, we feel it a duty to warn every parent against exposing his daughter to so fatal a contagion.

William Evans, ‎Thomas Evans
1837
...a fearful multitude of untutored savages... [boys] with dogs at their heels and other evidence of dissolute habits...[girls who] drive coal-carts, ride astride upon horses, drink, swear, fight, smoke, whistle, and care for nobody...the morals of children are tenfold worse than formerly.
Anthony Ashley Cooper, the 7th Earl of Shaftesbury, Speech to the House of Commons
February 28, 1843
... see the simpering little beau of ten gallanting home the little coquette of eight, each so full of self-conceit and admiration of their own dear self, as to have but little to spare for any one else... and confess that the sight is both ridiculous and distressing... the sweet simplicity and artlessness of childhood, which renders a true child so interesting, are gone (like the bloom of the peach rudely nipped off) never to return.
""Children And Children's Parties"", published in The Mothers' Journal and Family Visitant, S.B.S.
1853
Household luxuries, school-room steam-press systems, and, above all, the mad spirit of the times, have not come to us without a loss more than proportionate...[a young man] rushes headlong, with an impetuosity which strikes fire from the sharp flints under his tread...Occasionally, one of this class...amasses an estate, but at the expense of his peace, and often of his health. The lunatic asylum or the premature grave too frequently winds up his career...We expect each succeeding generation will grow ""beautifully less.""
“Degeneracy of Stature”, The National Era, Thrace Talmon
December 18, 1856
A pernicious excitement to learn and play chess has spread all over the country, and numerous clubs for practicing this game have been formed in cities and villages...chess is a mere amusement of a very inferior character, which robs the mind of valuable time that might be devoted to nobler acquirements, while it affords no benefit whatever to the body. Chess has acquired a high reputation as being a means to discipline the mind, but persons engaged in sedentary occupations should never practice this cheerless game; they require out-door exercises--not this sort of mental gladiatorship.
Scientific American
July, 1858
A mendacious umbrella is a sign of great moral degradation. Hypocrisy naturally shelters itself below a silk; while the fast youth goes to visit his religious friends armed with the decent and reputable gingham. May it not be said of the bearers of these inappropriate umbrellas that they go about the streets ""with a lie in their right hand""?
“The Philosophy of Umbrellas”, Robert Louis Stevenson
1894
“
‘We want to get married, but there is nowhere we can set up a house of our own. It is either a case of waiting goodness knows how long, and we've waited all the war, or, going to live with Mary's mother.’
How often is a similar remark heard in those days, for it is the problem that young people all over the country have to face. Thousands of young fellows have come home from the war intent on setting up a home with the girl of their heart only to find that there are no homes to be had… Many men, of course, have not waited for houses, but have got married and gone into rooms or to live with relatives, but neither course can be considered very satisfactory.”
Nowhere to Set Up House, Dundee Courier
1920
Never has youth been exposed to such dangers of both perversion and arrest as in our own land and day. Increasing urban life with its temptations, prematurities, sedentary occupations, and passive stimuli just when an active life is most needed, early emancipation and a lessening sense for both duty and discipline, the haste to know and do all befitting man's estate before its time, the mad rush for sudden wealth and the reckless fashions set by its gilded youth--all these lack some of the regulatives they still have in older lands with more conservative conditions.
The Psychology of Adolescence, Granville Stanley Hall
1904
“We defy anyone who goes about with his eyes open to deny that there is, as never before, an attitude on the part of young folk which is best described as grossly thoughtless, rude, and utterly selfish.”
The Conduct of Young People, Hull Daily Mail
1925
...[The screen artists'] beauty, their exquisite clothing, their lax habits and low moral standards, are becoming unconsciously appropriated by the plastic minds of American youth. Let them do what they may; divorce scandals, hotel episodes, free love, all are passed over and condoned by the young... The eye-gate is the widest and most easily accessible of all the avenues of the soul; whatever is portrayed on the screen is imprinted indelibly upon the nation's soul.
The Pentecostal Evangel
November 6, 1926
The bad manners of all parliaments, the general tendency to connive at a rather shady business transaction if it promises to bring in money without work, jazz and Negro dances as the spiritual outlet in all circles of society, women painted like prostitutes, the efforts of writers to win popularity by ridiculing...the correctness of well-bred people, and the bad taste shown even by the nobility and old princely families in throwing off every kind of social restraint and time-honoured custom: all of these go to prove that it is now the vulgar mob that gives the tone.
Hour of Decision, Oswald Spengler (translated by C.F. Atkinson, 1942)
1933
“The Chairman alluding to the problem of young people and their English said his experience was that many did not seem able to express or convey to other people what they meant. They could not put their meaning into words, and found the same difficulty when it came to writing.”
Unable to Express Thoughts: Failing of Modern Young People, Gloucester Citizen
1936
“Probably there is no period in history in which young people have given such emphatic utterance to a tendency to reject that which is old and to wish for that which is new.”
Young People Drinking More, Portsmouth Evening News
1936
“Cinemas and motor cars were blamed for a flagging interest among young people in present-day politics by ex-Provost JK Rutherford… [He] said he had been told by people in different political parties that it was almost impossible to get an audience for political meetings. There were, of course, many distractions such as the cinema…”
Young People and Politics, Kirkintilloch Herald
1938
“Parents themselves were often the cause of many difficulties. They frequently failed in their obvious duty to teach self-control and discipline to their own children.”
Problems of Young People, Leeds Mercury
1938
“…in youth clubs were young people who would not take part in boxing, wrestling or similar exercises which did not appeal to them. The
‘tough guy’
of the films made some appeal but when it came to something that led to physical strain or risk they would not take it.”
Young People Who Spend Too Much, Dundee Evening Telegraph
1945
“How to bring young people into membership of the Church was a pressing problem raised at a meeting… Sunday School teachers in the audience had found that children were apt to leave Sunday School when they had completed their day school education. They were not following on into the church.”
Why Do Young People Neglect Religion?, Shield Daily News
1947
“It’s an irony, but so many of us are a cautious, nervous, conservative crew that some of the elders who five years ago feared that we might come trooping home full of foreign radical ideas are now afraid that the opposite might be too true, and that we could be lacking some of the old American gambling spirit and enterprise.”
The Care and Handling of a Heritage: One of the “scared-rabbit” generation reassures wild-eyed elders about future, Life
1950
“Many [young people] were so pampered nowadays that they had forgotten that there was such a thing as walking, and they made automatically for the buses… unless they did something, the future for walking was very poor indeed.”
Scottish Rights of Way: More Young People Should Use Them, Falkirk Herald
1951
“A few [35-year-old friends] just now are leaving their parents’ nest. Many friends are getting married or having a baby for the first time. They aren’t switching occupations, because they have finally landed a ‘meaningful’ career – perhaps after a decade of hopscotching jobs in search of an identity. They’re doing the kinds of things our society used to expect from 25-year-olds.”
Not Ready for Middle Age at 35, Wall Street Journal
1984
“What really distinguishes this generation from those before it is that it's the first generation in American history to live so well and complain so bitterly about it.”
The Boring Twenties, Washington Post
1993
“The traditional yearning for a benevolent employer who can provide a job for life also seems to be on the wane… In particular, they want to avoid
‘low-level jobs that aren’t keeping them intellectually challenged.’
”
Meet Generation X, Financial Times
1995
“They have trouble making decisions. They would rather hike in the Himalayas than climb a corporate ladder. They have few heroes, no anthems, no style to call their own. They crave entertainment, but their attention span is as short as one zap of a TV dial.”
Proceeding with Caution, Time
2001
And one more reflection:
“He felt that the people who were giving that kind of charge, that sweeping condemnation, were generally out of touch with the young people…
‘I think that if we knew the boys and girls — and I am thinking particularly tonight the young people of Britain — of those modern times, we should feel that after all they are very much like ourselves. They think very much like ourselves only their expression of their thinking is a little bit different.’
”
Modern Young People: ‘A Glorious Lot’, Cornishman
1934
Notes:
when the young are to be silent before
their elders; how they are to show respect to them by standing and
making them sit; what honour is due to parents; what garments or shoes
are to be worn; the mode of dressing the hair; deportment and manners
in general.
And though
only the best of them will be appointed by their predecessors, still
they will be unworthy to hold their fathers' places, and when they
come into power as guardians, they will soon be found to fall in taking
care of us, the Muses, first by under-valuing music; which neglect
will soon extend to gymnastic; and hence the young men of your State
will be less cultivated.

His trial in Israel was attended by journalists from major newspapers worldwide and tapes of the coverage were flown daily to the United States where they were made available for broadcast nationally. Eichmann was not found guilty of all charges, but enough of the most severe charges were deemed sufficient to sentence him to death by hanging. Eichmann’s defense team appealed to the Supreme Court, but the appeal was unsuccessful. They then appealed to the president of Israel for clemency. Clemency was actually considered, especially after an emotional appeal from Eichmann’s wife and brothers and many well-respected Jewish statesmen, but ultimately denied. Eichmann was finally hanged on June 1 1962; the hanging itself was witnessed by journalists.
Through these proceedings Eichmann first claimed that he was not at all involved; then, when it was proven conclusively that he was, he insisted that he was just following orders and while he had been present at mass executions he did not arrange them personally. Eichmann’s defense team focused on questioning the admissibility of evidence, for which they were largely successful (hence his not being convicted on all charges).
At no time did Eichmann, his attorneys in their testimony, or his wife or brothers in their appeals, even attempt to suggest that the Holocaust was a hoax.
Think about that. Even if you believe that the entire trial was a sham designed to railroad an innocent man, even if you think that his entire (German and non-Jewish) defense team conspired against him, Eichmann was placed in front of hundreds of reporters and television cameras every day of a four month long trial, and never once did he turn to them and say “the so-called Holocaust never happened and I’m a totally innocent Argentinian,” even though (if there was any validity to his claim) that would have been the simplest way of preventing his own execution. Do you think he was brainwashed somehow into believing he had facilitated the deaths of millions while under arrest and interrogation? They would have also had to somehow brainwash his wife and his brothers, none of whom attempted a “there was no Holocaust” defense in their clemency letters.
In other words, to believe the Holocaust is a hoax is to believe in a conspiracy that involves some combination of all of Israel, a German defense team, hundreds of newspaper reporters from all over the world, a man’s wife and family, and the man himself, all of whom could have publicly denied the Holocaust for millions of newspaper readers and television viewers and chose not to, knowing it would lead to an innocent man’s death.

Hi my name is Bob Ballard. I’m a retired U.S. Navy officer and a National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence. Besides finding the sunken R.M.S. Titanic, I’ve also discovered the German battleship Bismarck, and a number of contemporary and ancient shipwrecks around the world. I’ve conducted more than 150 deep-sea expeditions using advanced exploration technology.

Don't Let Reddit Kill 3rd Party Apps!
What's going on?
A recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app
permanently inaccessible
to users.
On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from
Apollo
to
Reddit is Fun
to
Narwhal
to
BaconReader
to
Boost
.
Even if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface. 
This isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free.
What's the plan?
On June 12th,
many subreddits
will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away
permanently
unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because
we love Reddit
, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.
The two-day blackout isn't the
goal
, and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action.
What can
you
do?
Complain.
Message the mods of
/r/reddit.com
, who are the admins of the site: message
/u/reddit
: submit a
support request
: comment in relevant threads on
/r/reddit
, such as
this one
, leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app- and sign your username in support to this post.
Spread the word.
Rabble-rouse on related subreddits. Meme it up, make it spicy. Bitch about it to your cat. Suggest anyone you know who moderates a subreddit join us at our sister sub at
/r/ModCoord
- but please don't pester mods you
don't
know by simply spamming their modmail.
Boycott
and
spread the word...to Reddit's competition!
Stay off Reddit entirely on June 12th through the 13th- instead, take to your favorite
non
-Reddit platform of choice and make some noise in support!
Don't be a jerk.
As upsetting this may be, threats, profanity and vandalism will be worse than useless in getting people on our side. Please make every effort to be as restrained, polite, reasonable and law-abiding as possible.
How does this impact
r/history
?
Even if you only use the official Reddit app and/or ""New Reddit"" on desktop, this change still impacts all of us.
r/history
uses third party apps and browser extensions for its moderation. Even though I mostly use
r/toolbox
for my moderation, I have to use it through a special browser on my mobile to get it to work properly.
We believe that people who wish to use this subreddit in the way that's most accessible to them. We've also had several comments from people who are short sighted or even completely blind who cannot use the reddit mobile app to browse Reddit and require the use of third party apps. It's unfair for them to have to suffer.
We hope this gets the message across to Reddit. We love this Reddit and I love this sub. I want to spend as long as I can beating down unofficial versions of history and making sure that big history has a suitable place to operate from for many years to come.

(attachment in post)","My father (1919-2007) was a London-born, Dutch national, part of the World War II Dutch Underground/Resistance Movement and a German Concentration Camp survivor.  He was held captive in Krakow, Bergen-Belsen, before finally being liberated from Auschwitz by the Allied forces. Losing the majority of his family and friends in the camps, he spent most of life trying to forget his experiences, and then, spent the latter years of his life trying to remember them.
He passed away 10 years ago, leaving behind his historical fiction manuscript.  He wasn’t a writer and was not educated past high school due to the war starting; nevertheless, he was smart and hard-working and spent the better part of a decade working on it in the 1980s.

It's about his personal experiences and the personal stories of those he was friends with in the resistance and the concentration camps as told through the eyes of a fictional young, talented Dutch footballer who crosses paths with his pre-war German football rival several years into the War.  The protagonist finds that his rival, now a vindictive and powerful Nazi Commandant, is in-charge of the very Concentration Camp the young Dutchman was sent to, but his arrival there was hardly a coincidence: the German is intent on cruel revenge and the Dutchman must escape or suffer a fate worse than death. It’s a story of true accounts and real people channelled through a fictional story of a personal rivalry between two sporting heroes turned prisoner/captor.
While the first four chapters serve only to start introductions to the various lead characters and begin to establish their motivations, the plot (which really begins when the protagonist becomes imprisoned in a concentration camp) is a tale of jealously, revenge and clever escape with themes that include youthful exuberance, love, conspiracy, world sports, Hitler, political intrigue, revenge, torture and deceit; all set in a global climate of rising Fascism, intolerance and corrupt officials.
This manuscript is easy-to-read, compelling, and tells an exciting story. Even though I was only 12 years old when he completed it, I know the manuscript generated quite a bit of interest in Hollywood for a few years around the time he completed it, and that Willem Dafoe (actor) and Mervyn LeRoy (director) were personally championing the project, but partly due to LeRoy's untimely death, it was never made into a film.  That was thirty years ago.
My wife and I have spent time trying to get it published on our own, but as a reserved and shy couple that doesn’t spend much time “online,” our results have been mostly lacklustre.  But, we still believe that it can get published traditionally as my father had wished. While this is rather uncomfortable for us, we decided to see if social media can help bring us closer to the right people.
Linked is a pdf

with the first 4 chapters of the manuscript to find an interested publisher for this book. We're not sure how many unpublished books-of-quality there are by actual Holocaust Survivors left in the world, so we decided to start sharing my father's work with kind people via Reddit, hopeful that a good person can help get his story out there.

The Myth
In movies or historical documentaries, we’ve seen it time and time again. Two armies meet for the final time and soldiers of both sides, disregarding any sense of self-preservation,
suicidally charge
into each other and intermingle with the enemy soldiers. Such chaos ensues that it
looks like a giant mosh pit at a rave
in which it’s impossible to
tell friend from foe
, but somehow, the people still know who to strike. They engage in
individual duels all over the field
.
When we think about it, we might ask:
„How did medieval soldiers tell friend from foe in battle?“ A very common question both on Reddit and Quora. Others might ask how did the frontline soldiers deal with the fact that they’re basically going to die – because standing in the frontline means certain death, right? That’s how it’s depicted in the movies, right? Battles were chaotic, it had to be like that! Right?
As Jonathan Frakes would put it: No way. Not this time. It’s false. It’s totally made up. It’s fiction. We made it up. It’s a total fabrication. Not this time. It’s false. It’s a myth.
It’s a bad movie trope.
Why the trope doesn’t make sense
Humans, in general, are usually not very keen on dying or getting themselves seriously injured or crippled. We all wish to return back unscathed to our homes, families and friends. This is called
self-preservation
.
Why would medieval soldiers behave differently than any other human being?
The point is, if you run into a crowd of armed people with no regards to your safety, you die without any contribution to the battle-effort. And no one wants to die like that.
By running out of your crowd towards the enemy crowd, you lose all defensive advantages which being in a crowd provides. You will not only have enemies in front of you but everywhere around you. When that happens, it’s all over. That’s just it. Hypothetically, all your buddies could do it all at once and get as far as the fourth rank, but that will only lead to more wasteful death. This is no way to wage a battle! You don’t need to
experience it
to know it’s bullshit. Nor you need to be a trained veteran to know it’s a suicide. It’s
a common sense
. Yes, it might have looked good once in
Braveheart
25 years ago, but when I see it in a modern TV show like
Vikings
or in a movie like
Troy
or
The King(2019)
, it robs me of the pleasure watching it and I’d genuinely love to see it done the right way for once. If Total War games can get it almost right, why can’t the movies?
The point is, if you stay in your crowd, keeping your enemy only in front of you, while being surrounded by your friends from left, right and behind, your chances of survival increase. It is no coincidence that many different cultures over the history of mankind perfected their fighting cohesion in this manner and some even named it like
phalanx
or
scildweall
.
Battle dynamics – What a medieval battle looks like
(Everytime there is a high stake situation, in which two huge crowds of humans gather in one place to solve a dispute by beating each other with sharp sticks to death or some other serious injury, an invisible line forms between them. (Doesn’t need to be a straight line.) If the stakes are not high and we’re in some silly football hooligan fist-fight brawl, people just ignore the line and the battle indeed becomes a chaotic mess. But the higher the stakes (possible death or other serious crippling injury), the lower the eagerness to cross that invisible line. Especially when there's a dozen fully armored men with sharp sticks pointed at you.
That is
the battle line
.
That’s why men in most medieval and ancient engagements over the course of history were arranged in most natural formation - the line formation. In small skirmishes, it might not be as vital for victory, but the larger the battle is, the more important it is to keep the line together. If this battle line is broken somewhere and the enemy pour in, the cohesion is lost and it will be easier for the opposing army to flank and overwhelm the smaller clusters of men that form as a result of their line being broken. But it also means the battle is coming to an end and that’s when people usually start running and for those who stay, chaos like in movies ensues.
But let’s not get ahead of ourselves, we’re still in the battle phase.
Do you have the image in mind? That’s right, the actual battle is only done by the first rank (and maybe second and third, if the length of their weapons allows, like spears or polearms), while the rest are maybe throwing projectiles or simply waiting to switch the frontline soldiers if they get too exhausted or injured.
Pulse Theory (The most accurate battle model)
Few historians came up with a model called
Pulse theory
(or
'Pulse model theory'
) where they explain the crowd dynamics of a battle. I believe this model is the most accurate model we’ve come up with and it would be brilliant if movies began adopting it. That's why I'm writing about it, as I would like that more and more historical enthusiasts know about it.
In short, the armies meet and the front lines engage in harsh and heated mêlée battle. After minutes of sustained pressure, the two sides back away few paces or even whole meters away from the weapon reach. Maybe some brave show-offs step forward to exchange few blows and insults. The soldiers are maybe throwing their javelins and darts or rocks. Injured men get replaced before the two sides again engage for few minutes and disengage. This goes on and on for hours, since, as we know, battles lasted for hours. It doesn't happen all at once over the whole field, of course not. Instead only in small groups, sometimes here and sometimes there, sometimes elsewhere. Hence the name,
pulse theory
.
The reason for this is that it is psychologically and biologically (stamina) impossible for human to endure an engagement for hours. If you put yourself in the shoes of a medieval soldier, this makes sense, doesn't it? If one side backs away, but the other is overly eager to continue the fight no matter what, the battle is coming to an end.
Frontline =/= death sentence
So far I’ve adressed why it is totally nonsensical and unrealistic to depict battles as mosh pits and introduced far more realistic model of battle. Let us adress another trope and that is – being in frontline is a certain death. For this I would simply like to bring to attention two brilliant answers written by
u/Iguana_on_a_stick
and
u/Iphikrates
which you can find in
this thread
.
(It was their answers that inspired me to re-write what they’ve already written down there 4 years ago into this subreddit. Thus I begin my quest to introduce pulse theory to movies by spreding the elightenment.)
In short, they explain the winning sides usually, more often than not, suffered only minimal casualties. You can verify this on Wikipedia, if the battle page entry records casualties and you’ll notice the ratio yourself.
Additionally and this is important for any ancient or medieval warfare enthusiast out there, they explain why the most casualties occured not during the battle phase as movies would have you believe, but in the very last stage of the battle - after one side begins fleeing from the field. Men are more easily mowed down from behind and running rather than if they stand together in a crowd, holding shields and spears.
Shield pushing
Lastly, they provide criticisism of
othismos
or '
shield pushing'
(a shoving match between two sides with their shields) that, according to some older historians, occured during the ancient battles. (And medieval battles as well, basically.) The battle then becomes a sort of a shoving match between two sides. Everytime a TV show or a movie attempts to depict a battle not like a total mess, they depict it like people shoving their shields into each other. You might have seen something similar in the shieldwall battle on
The Last Kingdom TV Show
. And we've all heard it in connection to hoplites.
Personally, I appreciate the show for the attempt (although it devolves into chaotic mess at the end anyway even before the rout), but I'm absolutely not convinced that
othismos
or
'shield pushing'
was a realistic way to fight simply due to it being highly suicidal. Your shield loses its protective function. It's only possible to do it in low stake reconstructions, where the people are not afraid of death and thus are not afraid to close the distance. I'll admit that occasional pushes before quick retreats might have occured, though. Especially if one side noticed the other is already weavering.
It was more about using your spears and sniping around the shields of your enemies and look for weaknesses. But I'm open to discussion in this regard.
Chaos
At last, we come to the premise of this post. So were battles chaotic? Yes, most definitely! But not how movies portray.
Imagine this: You are far away from home. Since the morning, you’ve been standing on some field in the middle of nowhere together with your fellow soldiers, all clad in armor during a hot summer day. Maybe two hours ago, something has finally started happening and you've already been in few clashes. You don't really know what's happening 1 kilometer or 1 mile away from you elsewhere on the field. You trust your commanders know what they're doing and you pray to whatever diety you worship. What you know for certain is that you're tired and sick in the stomach from the stress. Everywhere there’s human smell and you’re sweating your balls off as well. There’s barely enough air to breathe, just like there’s no air on a concert. Maybe you’ve even pissed yourself because there was no time to take off all the armor. You don’t know what to think and what to feel. Your whole body is telling you ‚Get out! Go home!‘ but you know you cannot just abandon your place. You most likely don't even know where exactly you are. A javelin that comes out of nowhere brings you back to full consciousness and hits your cousin standing right beside you in the face. Now they’re dragging him somewhere to the back. You might even think that you’re winning, you‘re gaining ground, while the bastards opposite of you are constantly backing away. But then you suddenly find out, that your entire flank a mile away has been routed. You see men in the far distance running for their lives away from the field towards the forest on the hill sides, while being pursued by riders on horses. You have no idea whether to hold your ground or to run as well.
That is chaotic indeed. And if the filmmakers decide one day to portray this chaos as such instead of glorifying unnecessary gore just for the sake of gore, I’m going to celebrate.
Additional information and examples:
At the end, I would like to provide some interesting examples of high stake engagements I've found on youtube, which prove that high stakes engagements are hardly ever fought like they are fought in the movies. Invisible battle lines and to an extend, pulse theory,  are observable.
First example is
a police riot clash
, with police being in organized retreat. The clash is happening in the middle where two crowds meet, not all over the field, as movies would like to have you believe. The most dangerous thing that can happen to you, is when you are pulled into the enemy line – something which movies don’t get. Something similar might be observable in
the second police riot clash
.
Third is
a high stake fight in a jail
. As one side is attacked out of nowhere, the fight begins very chaotically. After a while, an invisible, very dynamic battle-line forms.
My last and most favorite example is
a skirmish battle on Papua New Guinea
. Not much of a mêlée battle, but very interesting nonetheless. The best example of pulse theory in a skirmish engagement.
I wanted to include some false examples of battle reconstructions and Battle of the Nations, but these aren't high stakes situations and people in them do not behave as they would if their lives were on the line.

subreddit is a goldmine that not only inspired, but fueled this whole post. There are tons of amazing threads that delve in historical warfare, I recommend reading it.
Last thought
: My post has focused on infantry combat. I'm willing to admit that
mounted cavalry combat
might indeed have more movie-like chaotic character. This is a question I'm still gathering information about and thus I'm not able to make any claims yet, although there are already so many medieval battles which begin by two cavalry engaging. If you have some knowledge, I'd love to hear about it!
EDIT:
Wow! It was a pleasant surprise to see all your responses, I'm so glad you enjoyed the read. One huge thank you for all the awards and everything! This might sound utterly silly, I know, but the purpose is to spread the knowledge (and increase people's expectations from a historical genre) so that in the end, one day, we might get a movie with a perfect battle. Although this post is just a drop in the sea, the knowledge is spreading and I'm glad for it.
EDIT2: Found another academic source of the discussed theory. Check out the article
The Face of Roman Battle (
The Journal of Roman Studies) by P. Sabin, where he discusses everything in this post in more detail than my previous source.",

It's the oldest known reference to a ""haunted house""","""There was at Athens a large and roomy house, which had a bad name, so that no one could live there. In the dead of the night a noise, resembling the clashing of iron, was frequently heard, which, if you listened more attentively, sounded like the rattling of chains, distant at first, but approaching nearer by degrees: immediately afterwards a spectre appeared in the form of an old man, of extremely emaciated and squalid appearance, with a long beard and dishevelled, hair, rattling the chains on his feet and hands. The distressed occupants meanwhile passed their wakeful nights under the most dreadful terrors imaginable. This, as it broke their rest, ruined their health, and brought on distempers, their terror grew upon them, and death ensued. Even in the daytime, though the spirit did not appear, yet the impression remained so strong upon their imaginations that it still seemed before their eyes, and kept them in perpetual alarm. Consequently the house was at length deserted, as being deemed absolutely uninhabitable; so that it was now entirely abandoned to the ghost.""
He then goes on to write about how the City of Athens posted a warning to future buyers, but a stranger to Athens bought it because of the extremely low price. The buyer did experience everything he was warned about and even saw the ghost itself. It led him to a certain spot in the house and then vanished. The next day he asked the lawmakers of Athens for permission to dig up that spot.
He then says, ""the skeleton of a man in chains was found there; for the body, having lain a considerable time in the ground, was putrefied and mouldered away from the fetters. The bones, being collected together, were publicly buried, and thus after the ghost was appeased by the proper ceremonies, the house was haunted no more.""",

Edit: I never imagined this post being viewed a quarter million times. I enjoy reading all the comments. A common and understandable thread is disbelief,  but it appears to me that this event did in fact happen. Of course the numbers are questionable, but consider the possibilities in light of information from some commenters knowledgeable of the era and subject. The Qin dynasty (with a population of around 40 million, comparable to the napoleonic empire 2,000 years later) practiced universal conscription, meaning every adult male could be drafted and every adult could be mobilized for state projects. ""Fielding one million men for the Qin was certainly possible"" writes Charles Holcombe, so the size of the army was not out of question. In 1912, workers on the Longhai Railway in Henan, (where the burial is said to have occured) discovered burial pits containing human remains. This area was known by locals as the ""million people pit"" and was reported to be 400 meters long and 250 meters wide. Certainly big enough for the 200,000 reported, although many think the number was much smaller.",
