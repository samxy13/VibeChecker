fitness,https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4pl3yc/things_i_wish_i_knew_8_years_ago/,19489,653,Things I Wish I Knew 8 Years Ago,"I've been seriously lifting weights for eight years now. Looking back at when I first started, I did so many things wrong but it took me a lot of trial and error to get where I'm at today. By no means do I know everything now -- not even close. I finished school with a BS in Kinesiology and got my CSCS from the National Strength and Conditioning Association, and will start my Master's program in the fall. There have been many times where I was dead-set on being right about things, only to later find out I was wrong.
That's the beauty of exercise and strength training: continuing to learn and grow. You should never be complacent with what you know. Buy books, read articles, ask around your gym. You can only benefit from this. You can add to what you already have in your arsenal and become a complete package. Here are some things I wish I knew when I started 8 years ago. (Disclaimer: this is mainly directed at beginners, but some of these things may be new to you even if you've been lifting for some time)
Just because your numbers are going up doesn't mean you're doing the exercise right.
I remember hitting plenty of milestones in regards to benching, squatting, and deadlifting. However, I would later find out little things I was doing wrong that could have led to injury. Fixing these minor tweaks made the exercises much harder, but I felt much stronger and safer because of them.
Mobility work is extremely important.
After a couple years of lifting, I was at the top of the world. I was bigger, stronger, had more confidence, etc. However, I didn't realize how tight I was, and how that was restricting much of what I did in the weight room and in my life. If you don't know much about mobility, do some research. Thoracic spine mobility, shoulder mobility, hip mobility, ankle mobility, the list goes on and on. Look up people like Kelly Starrett, Eric Cressey, Matthew Ibraham, and others. They all have YouTube channels and their attention to detail in regards to range of motion, stability, and mobility are some of the most useful and eye-opening pieces of information you can find.
Never underestimate the power of warming up.
I see a lot of people walk into the gym, do a couple of shoulder circles, then jump into their workout. I used to do the same thing. However, once I started adding in dynamic warmups and prehab/mobility exercises before lifting, I noticed a world's difference. Consider the exercises you'll be doing that day and work on those areas before you hit the weights.
Compound movements really do trump all.
This was a hard lesson for me to learn. I used to do the typical back/biceps, chest/triceps, shoulders/traps, legs split (which, depending on your goals, isn't necessarily a bad thing). However, once I switched over to Push/Pull/Leg splits, I really noticed a change in my body. Cut down the isolation work. Focus on exercises that will truly challenge your strength, stability, and coordination. Pull ups, chin ups, bent over rows, squats, deadlifts, RDLs, overhead presses, bench/incline bench, pushups, dips, cleans, snatches, etc. Those are the exercises that should make up the majority of your workouts. Find ways to make them harder if you've already mastered them. Not only will your strength increase, but you'll look even better.
The best core work you can do (in terms of both safety and results) doesn't involve crunches and russian twists
Just hear me out on this one. I used to do the usual ab exercises -- sit ups, crunches, leg raises, russian twists, side bends, etc. While these will all work your abs, they do little to nothing to help your overall core stability. Start using movements that will help you in your other lifts (and they will strengthen and grow your abs as well). These movements refer to anti-extension/flexion, anti-rotation, rotational movements, etc. I've been doing these exercises for my core and have noticed my other lifts improve because of them (in addition to being extremely sore the next day): Hanging leg raises, Pallof presses, landmine rotations, woodchops, planks on a stability ball, rollouts (wheel or stability ball), dead bugs, bird dogs, back extensions, dragonfly's, rotational throws, plank slides with gliders, side planks, farmer carries, overhead carries, L sits, etc. A lot of these can be done on one knee or can be made harder by taking away an arm or leg. Basically, any exercise that challenges your body's ability to stay stable has a profound effect on your overall strength and still give you that ab soreness that so many people desire (even though that's not what we're after..but you know what I'm saying). Another note on this: people tend to think of the ""core"" as just your abs. But your core is actually all of the structures that support your trunk and limbs. This includes your abdominals, obliques, shoulder joints, hip joints, lower back muscles, etc. By strengthening these areas, you improve your trunk rigidity. When your trunk rigidity increases, it allows more freedom of movement from your limbs. All proximal tightness will improve distal ROM.
Kettlebells are AWESOME
I avoided kettlebells for a very long time up until these past few years. Talk about a game-changer. Kettlebells allow you to do some crazy movements that'll challenge your body in ways that you didn't think possible. Kettlebell swings are towards the top of my list. Not only are they great for glute strength/power, but it has a carryover effect for teaching proper hip hinge mechanics, and is a great tool to add in for high intensity conditioning. Turkish get ups, windmills, clean and presses, one-armed presses, goblet squats (great for beginners), and many other exercises challenge you in a unique way. If you haven't tried training with kettlebells, I recommend you start now.
Cardio really, really, really does not have to be a drag
I know a lot of people have recently moved away from the long duration treadmill, elliptical, stair-stepper, and biking trend that has dominated the fitness culture for so long. But a lot of people still limit themselves to just that. Circuits and HIIT are truly superior if you want to add in cardio work. Not only is it faster, but it's way less boring and much more fun and effective. Some ideas of exercises to use for your conditioning: PROWLER PUSHES, kettlebell swings, rower intervals, ball slams (both front and side to side), plyometric work, speed ladders, tire flips, mountain climbers, box jumps, sprints, battle ropes, jump ropes, sled pulls (with a rope, working primarily your back), etc. These will not only leave you gassed but also work your entire body instead of just your legs. The possibilities are endless.
Writing out, or following, a detailed workout program will get you to that next level
I can't tell you how many of my workouts in years past consisted of me walking into the gym and meandering from exercise to exercise. Sure I walked out with a nice pump, but how did I know I actually made any progress. When I follow a pre-written routine, I go into the gym on a mission. I know what I'm going to do, how many times, and how much weight I'll use. This really drills discipline into you. Some days you come in feeling sluggish, but if you have a routine set up, you know that you must finish what you wrote down. Otherwise, you'd probably cut your workout short. Having a specific goal changes your mindset completely. Tracking your progress keeps you honest and prepared. Looking back on your numbers and seeing them increase is an awesome feeling. Look into programs like 5/3/1, starting strength, PHAT, just to name a few. Or, if you feel competent enough, write up your own. Take progress pictures. Track your numbers. It is essential for success.
Learn your damn anatomy.
A lot of things really started clicking for me once I began studying anatomy and physiology. Although it may be boring, once you learn about where each bone is, where your muscles originate and insert, how the contraction process takes place, etc. then you will start viewing lifting in a whole new light. Biomechanics is a big one too. These things can change how you lift and help you pay more attention to your technique. For instance, you know you need to keep your elbows back to target your triceps during dips, but do you know WHY? Did you know that your pec actually inserts onto your humerus (arm bone) therefore when you keep your arms close you're essentially taking the pec out of [majority of] the movement? Not only will this help you, but it will help if someone ever needs advice or has any ""why"" questions. Do your muscles flex? Well, no they don't. Your joints flex and extend. Your muscles contract and relax. Find out the function of each muscle, what muscles contribute to elbow/shoulder/hip/knee extension and flexion, and you'll learn a lot of new things. Look up websites like getbodysmart.com which have great illustrations of muscle function and placement.
Nutrition and sleep really are as important as people make them out to be.
I know, I know. Everyone has heard this by now. But I had to mention it. Just google the benefits of sleep if you don't know them, but they are substantial. Nutrition..well, I could write an entire essay on that subject alone but you must, and I mean MUST make this a priority over everything else. If you have your nutrition on point, everything else will come with relative ease. Don't undermine its importance.
Breathing mechanics are important.
This is one that I've really had to learn to incorporate lately. And I'm not talking about the typical ""exhale when exerting/using concentric contractions and inhale during lowering/eccentric contractions. I'm talking about proper breathing and rib alignment. Google or YouTube proper breathing mechanics and setup. 90/90 breathing is a great exercise to use. Most of us here are chest breathers, when in reality we need to be using our diaphragms. This will change the way you do pretty much every exercise.
Film yourself.
I'm adding this one a day late because it totally slipped my mind last night. There's a difference between what you feel like you're doing and what you're ACTUALLY doing. The best way to find out the truth is to film yourself from the side. This is such a big help, especially if you're wondering how your form is. Try to have a friend film you squat or deadlift in slow motion, and watch the video carefully. Look at how you initiate the movement, if/when you start rounding your back, how your head position looks, etc. Or, you can even film yourself doing these exercises in your room with no weight. Although it may sound weird, doing certain exercises with a shirt off will actually show you the muscles themselves moving, and if you do an exercise from a rear view you can see your spinal mechanics at work. It's really an interesting thing to do and will help you spot any errors and correct your form.
That's all I could think of for now, but I'm sure there's a lot more. I figured if it was longer than this I'd lose your attention (unless I already lost you a long time ago).
Like I said earlier, by no means do I know everything. Not even close. But in order to be the best you can be in the world of physical fitness, you must continue to learn and experiment. Be proud of where you are, but ask yourself what aspects you're ignoring or could improve. Much love

Edit 2: Getting a lot of specific questions regarding what's best for warming up and mobility. Like I've stated, the internet is your friend. If you want to know how to warm up for a squat or bench press, just YouTube ""bench press warm up"" or ""squat mobility."" There is so much information out there, Google and YouTube are goldmines for finding stuff like that.

fitness,https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/7ye7r2/how_to_do_pull_ups_properly_and_how_to_do_your/,14127,512,How to do PULL UPS properly and how to do your first pullup if you can't do any. 💪,"Hi everybody, Antranik here. I created these two videos recently to improve upon the
r/bodyweightfitness Recommended Routine (""RR"")
and I'm sharing them here as well. The link is in the header and the summary is below them.
1.
Video: How to do Proper Pullups
There are two phases of a pullup: The scapular pull in the beginning (with straight arms) and then the actual pullup.  This can be done in one fluid motion but if you take a video of yourself and find your shoulders remain shrugged up
or
if you can barely get the chin-over, you should consciously focus on improving your scapular pull.
Also, make sure you're
going down ALL THE WAY
and NOT doing half-ROM pullups which are
super
common. Another tip is to keep your feet uncrossed, thighs together and in front of you as it will make you stronger.
2.
Video: How to do pullups if you can't do any
In part two, I demonstrate how to
perform negative pullups properly,
emphasizing
the importance of lifting/tucking the knees up as you lower down so that your feet dont hit the ground before your arms are straight.
Your goal is to do 10-second negatives.
If you can't control the negative, then you need to work on your rows (incline rows to be exact) which are an easier pulling exercise and a prerequisite for pullups. In the RR, we recommend you get to 3 sets of 8 reps (""3x8"") of horizontal rows before moving to the pullup progression.
If you are unsure how or where to do rows, review the video on
bodyweight rows here

The Stretches
Upper Body (
Video
)
Shoulder Backbend
| The shoulder backbend focuses on shoulder overhead flexibility. This is important for many weightlifting exercises, but also for handstands and hand-balancing. It is also important for shoulder health, especially when older. Stand up with a straight bodyline, tense your butt muscles and move your arms overhead. Move your arms backwards without losing the straight bodyline. (
Video
)
Spine Backbend
| The spine backbend focuses on thoracic spine mobility. If you ever dreamt of doing bridges on the floor, this is your exercise. A good thoracic spinal mobility can be progressed into all kinds of
fancy exercises
. Place your palms (or fingertips) on your shoulderblades and tense your butt. Now lean back without arching your lower back and move the arms. You can bend the knees a little. (
Video
)
Rear Hand Clasp
| Did you ever want to scratch your back but couldn't reach the spot because you lacked behind-the-back flexibility? This is your exercise. It's good for your shoulderblades and to counter long sitting periods. This stretch is very important for upper body posture aswell! Get into a straight bodyline. Take a towel, a band or a t-shirt and grab both ends with your arms. One arm is overhead and one is behind the back. The upper arm pulls the lower arm gently into the stretch. Pull upwards. (
Video
)
Lying Cross
| The lying cross is a stretch that is aimed at people with poor posture. Start on all fours and move one arm below the other arm until your shoulder
touches the floor.
To deepen the stretch, lay down on the floor and extend the non-stretched arm to the front. (
Video
)
Wrist-Biceps Stretch
| This stretch works on your wrist flexibility and stretches your forearms, your biceps and your deltoid muscles. Stand next to a wall and place your palms on it. Fingers pointing backwards. Now straighten your arm and twist your upper body to the opposite direction. (
Video
)
Lower Body (
Video
)
One-Leg Pike
| This stretches your hamstrings. Most people that sit on a computer all day have tight hamstrings, because those muscles are very tensed in a chair-sitting position. When you stretch them regularily, you can take load off your lower back. Flexible hamstrings progress into
the pike stretch
. Place your foot on a chair and lean forward with a straight back. If you're advanced enough to touch your toes with a straight back (!), then you can progress to the
standing version of the stretch.
(
Video
)
Kneeling Lunge
| The kneeling lunge works on your hamstrings, your quads and your hip muscles like the iliopsoas. This is the most important stretch to gain flexibility for the
front splits
. Place one foot in front of you and extend it slowly with a straight back. Use your hands to balance yourself properly. (
Video
)
Pancake
| The pancake stretches your hamstrings and your leg adductors. With strong leg adductors, you will have it much easier in martial arts and all dance moves. It also
looks really cool
in the full progression. Sit on the floor with a straight back and extend the legs to both sides. Lean forward. (
Video
)
Butterfly
| A strong butterfly is a prequisite for
the lotus sit.
Sit on the floor with a straight back and move your soles together. Grab them with your hands and gently pull forward with a straight back. Try to bring your knees to the floor. If that's not yet possible, feel free to place a pillow under your knees. (
Video
)
Calf Stretch
| Many people neglect their calf muscles, although it is necessary to give your calves some love. Tight calves love to cramp and hurt. It can prevent heel spurs and all kind of degenerative feet diseases to regularily stretch and strengthen your feet muscles. Grab something and bend one knee forward. Extend the back leg and try to push the heel into the ground. (
Video
)
Frequently Asked Questions
Why didn't you include [insert stretch]?!
Starting To Stretch is meant to give you the best ""bang for your buck"" and focuses on the most common problem areas. Feel free to insert your own specific stretch into the program!
How often should i do this program?
A good starting point would be two times a week. If you have the time, do it three times a week! If you lack time, split it up into upper and lower body and do both once a week.
Can i do this every day?
Absolutely! However, if you feel pain or discomfort, do it a bit less. Your muscles need rest too and stretching is taxing your nervous system quite hard.
I have medical condition [insert here], can i do the program?
There's no one-size-fits-all answer for this one. Ask on the subreddit and people will make sure to help you with your specific problem.
When should i do the program?
Any time when you are relatively stress free is perfect. When your mind is relaxed, stretching is easier. Don't do it before a workout, because it increases injury risk. After a workout is fine!
I don't like this stretch: [insert stretch], can i replace it with something else?
Absolutely! You won't benefit from stretches that you don't do, because you hate them. Switch them up as much as you like and need.

fitness,https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3qft9h/smoking_increases_risk_of_lung_cancer_2500_bacon/,13331,1214,"Smoking increases risk of lung cancer 2,500%. Bacon increases risk of colon cancer 18%. (Followup to yesterday's meat/cancer WHO post.)","According to this article in Wired
, processed and cooked meat does increase risk of colon cancer, but far less than smoking cigarettes increases risk of lung cancer.
The scientific evidence linking both processed meat and tobacco to certain types of cancer is strong. In that sense, both are carcinogens. But smoking increases your relative risk of lung cancer by 2,500 percent; eating two slices of bacon a day increases your relative risk for colorectal cancer by 18 percent. Given the frequency of colorectal cancer, that means your risk of getting colorectal cancer over your life goes from about 5 percent to 6 percent and, well, YBMMV. (Your bacon mileage may vary.) “If this is the level of risk you’re running your life on, then you don’t really have much to worry about,” says Alfred Neugut, an oncologist and cancer epidemiologist at Columbia.
The same tiny risk profile appears to be present for other red meats.
Anyway, the article is worth a read. And if you are a smoker, quitting is still the #1 thing you can do for your health.
EDIT:
Smoking also is correlated with colorectal cancers
and you can
lower your risk for colon cancer by exercising, losing weight, drinking less alcohol, eating more fiber in the form of whole grains and vegetables
, and getting regular screening after the age of 50. A vegetarian diet was associated with a 22% lower risk for colon cancer in one study, but
a pescatarian diet was even lower at 43% reduced risk
, probably due to the Vitamin D and Omega 3 fatty acids.
EDIT2: And just for even more perspective,
30-60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical exercise daily may reduce colon cancer risk by 30-40% according to the National Cancer Institute.",

This will be my final post on this unless something major happens in the future. Once again, I want to thank
/r/Fitness
for all the support you've given me this past year, I truly appreciate it and hope I can repay it in kind.
Just-Show-me-the-Photos...
Before/After Photos
TL;DWTR (aka I've got a minute, give me the juicy details):
So, it has been 1 year since I hit my 200lbs loss, ~9 months since I got below 200lbs for the first time in my adult life, and just over 6 months since I underwent skin removal surgery where the removed ~244 sq inches of skin. To make it short, it has been one crazy year. This post is both an update for all of the above, plus an update on my diet/exercise plan (as per the rules).
The surgery went well, but as you can see from the photos I'm kind of lopsided. My right side did not turn out as well as my left. As far as weight, I have maintained my 200lbs weight loss throughout the entire surgery, recovery and now as I work to regain what strength/muscle I lost.
Below is a VERY abbreviated backstory, the original is still
available here
and the second
update is here
​
Quick Background:
I won't rehash the whole story again as the original posts from last year are still available, links below.
​When I was a kid I was told I would never be fat. By the time I graduated from High School I was ~320lbs. Starting my Junior year of college I moved to main campus, weighing about 390, and reached 400+ by end of the 1st year on campus. Second year on campus was when I reached my recorded max of 407.8lbs. It is likely that I weighed more, but the 407.8 figure is the highest I found logged by a medical office, so it is the one I use.
Diet:
For the 2 years I have stuck to IIFYM, which is, in my humble opinion, the best out of the options I've personally tried. Approximately, 1800-1900 cals/day cutting. After the surgery I was told I had to eat, so I reverse dieted to 2000 to aid recovery. But this translated into ""eat all the foods"" since I didn't really have anything else to do. This did put some fat back on me since all I could do was sit and walk short distances. But I did maintain the 200lbs loss for a year now and have never crossed back into that.
I shoot for 130g of food-based protein, minimum, regardless of diet or supplementation. Even on cheat days. But I usually get more like 180g a day.
Fat is usually under 45g/day, carbs make up the rest.
Typical Meals:
Breakfast:
60g Oatmeal sweetened w/ Splenda, 4 piece of toast from Heiner's 35 calorie bread
Pre-Workout:
Large Apple
Lunch:
8oz chicken breast, 250g sweet potato.
Protein Bar
Rarely, but I prefer ones that don't go under a 10cal:1g protein ratio. (eg. 200cal bar w/ 20g protein)
Dinner:
6-8oz Lean meat, veggies, and I end the day's eating @ 6-7pm with a single serving protein pancake w/ SF syrup. Kodiak Dark Chocolate is hands down the best IMO.
I don't personally believe in supplementation. Just a personal thing. But, I will drink some Myprotein-brand BCAAs after a particularly difficult workout, but nothing else. I do occasionally use protein powder, but it is usually to cook with, not drink, and when I do get some it is usually Myprotein or ON brand.
Exercise:
My approach to fitness, given my age, is functional with a heavy slant on looking decent. I would like to have abs just one time in my life, just to look like the classic ""male."" However, over the last few weeks I have realized that I just wasn't putting my all into it. I realize that, technically, I am still recovering from a massive surgery where the front of my body was split in twain. But, I never get sore anymore, I rarely mix up my exercises. I didn't add in new ones. I did a strict split and just tried to put up more weight. I told myself that
insert exercises I was good at
exercises is what I could do due to
insert BS excuse here
and never pushed forward.
Then I met a good friend of mine, who is 18 years old. 21 years my junior, a local soccer star, cross country State finalist, and still hits the gym everyday. He pushes me harder than anyone I have ever met, refuses the ""nonsense"" of my age until I have actually tried something new. It reminds me of my niece who always says ""I don't like that"" when you offer something new to eat. For me it's ""Im too old/weak/recovering for that."" He doesn't accept that until I have tried. If I could give any tip to someone new to this fitness/weight loss world it would be to find someone who doesn't take excuses. Not because you are paying them, but because they honestly know you well enough to see past the excuses, to see the person you could be.
Over the last few weeks I have been fine tuning a new program, it is still in progress but this is pretty close to the final plan. The idea was to move away from a regular split to something that mimicked a 2 day/wk split while making it accessible for someone who doesn't have the recovery ability of a 20 year old. Plus, adding in more functional movements and core to each day versus a dedicated day.
Each day is a Heavy/Light split, the Heavy area being the main focus of the day and the Light being a secondary day, but no reduction in weight, just a reduced number of exercises.
Split:
I don't have a set rep/set pattern for any exercise other than
10 reps for the first 2 sets of any exercise, then all additional sets are to failure.
Average range of sets is 4-8, depending on the exercise, weight, etc.
Monday
is Heavy Chest / Light Back + Chinups, Pushups, 3x Core Exercises
Tuesday
is Heavy Core / Light Legs + Pushups, Chinups, 2x Bicep Exercises
Weds
is Heavy Back / Light Chest +  Pushups, Vacuums, 2x Core Exercises
Thursday
is Deadlifts, Rackpulls, Pullovers, Pushups, 3x Core Exercises, Chinups
Friday
is Heavy Shoulders / Light Arms + Pushups, Asst. Pullups, 3x Core exercises
Sat
is Heavy Legs (focused) then Light Full Body (more or less I workout various things, all to failure, while I chat and enjoy the day) + Iso Bicep Exercises
Sun
is Rest Day
Breakdown of Exercises:
Chest:
Chest Press (Machine), Landmine Press, Sven Press, Flat Bench, Incline Bench
Back:
Machine Rows, Lat Pulldown, T-bar Row, Iso Low-Row, Cable Mid-Row, Lat Pressdown, Australian Pullups, DB Shrugs, I/T/Y/Ws, DB Rows, Lumbar Hyperextensions, Robbery Exercise w/ 20lb DBs
Core:
Core Twist, Flutter Kicks, Reverse Crunches, Oblique Crunches, V holds, V Ball Passes, Ab-Pullovers, Hanging Leg Lift, L-Sit, Roman Chair Crunches
Legs:
High Bar Squat, Goblet Squat, Air Squat, Barbell Calf Press, Leg Extensions, Glute Kickback Machine, Hamstring Curls, Glute Thrusts, Abd/Add Press, Leg Press
Shoulders:
DB Scap Holds, Dislocations, DB OHP, BB OHP, Lateral Raises, Plate Raises, Plate Steering (use a plate like a steering wheel)
Bicep/Tricep:
Standing DB Curl, Preacher Curls, Iso DB Curls, Cable Curls, Drag Curls, Hammer Curls, Tricep Pushdown, Tricep Cable Extension, Internal/External Rotator Cuff Cable Pulls
Again, these are all the same format.
10 reps for 2 sets, then everything else to failure with no hard set range.
Average is 4-8 sets, depends on exercise, weight, etc. Deadlifts are the odd man out, it is 5 reps each set, no set limits, just until I can't do it anymore or form breaks down. Usually it's 6-10 sets depending on weight progression.
The Mods asked me to elaborate on the weight progression of my fitness plan. Given my age I'm not really chasing the same dreams that the younger people are so my progression is more tailored to overall fitness. When I start a new exercise I find a weight that I can do 4-6 sets with, to failure each set, and that is where I start. However, this is not a hard and fast rule, some days as I start increasing the weight through the sets I get worn out and don't progress in weight that week. My goal is to push to failure each and every time. Overall I feel this gives a better workout for me and seems to still allow decent recovery.
As an example, I logged my previous deadlift day.
Set 1:
95lbs x 21 reps
Set 2:
115lbs x 17reps
Set 3:
135lbs x 13reps
Set 4:
185lbs x 10reps
Set 5:
205lbs x 6 reps
Set 6:
235lbs x 4 reps
Set 7:
235lbs x 3 reps
I do log my workouts, but I don't track # of reps. I only track that I did a set to failure, how many sets I did total, and the maximum weight used. This is done by putting an X or a dot next to exercise which denotes a completed set. Then at the end I write down the maximum weight used across the exercise.
Cardio:
I have slowly added in either
sprint cardio
(Sprints on the Treadmill Usually) or some
long slow cardio
(Stair Climber is still my favorite). I do this
3-4 days a week and I do at least 2x 2-minute Sprints every day but Saturday.
I also do rehab-given exercises for shoulders, knees, and back to maintain the health of those areas. Those are just peppered in throughout the week. I won't list these here,
if you have an injury, see a doctor/physio.
Yes, it is a lot each day. But I tend to thrive on a meticulously laid out plans. Plus, if I over-shoot in the plan, then Ill either overachieve daily or at least hit the mark in execution.
I've only been lifting heavy again for about 2.5 months between the surgery and my shoulder. So these are my horribly weak, Post Recovery Lifts (these are for reps of 3 of more, not 1RM)
Flat bench:
155lbs
Squat:
155lbs
Deadlift:
235lbs
Extras:
I like to hike/backpack, swim for distance, and I run on the rare occasion, but aside from the gym I don't do much in the way of sports.
​
Whats Next:
You can stamp a big ""VAIN"" on my forehead, but I want freaking abs. Just once. Also traps.
My gym mates and I just finished a 6 week ""Add-On"" plan I developed where we did vacuums and pushups every morning. I went from barely being able to do 15 pushups to easily being able to bust out 40-45 in one go. Everyone whined about the vacuums after the first 3 days, but now they are thanking me, it really is an undervalued exercise. Now that is done, I am planning to focus on my posture and my shoulders. I have some kyphosis in the upper back from years of being a computer geek then later a WoW nerd. So, I want to correct my posture as much as I can, which will translate into better, stronger shoulders.
I am also going to have to try and figure out how to get the other 1 or 2 skin removals I will need to look ""normal"". My rear flanks/love-handle area will absolutely need fixed and my chest will likely need to be fixed. Until that point, I will continue to lose fat and get as functionally strong as I can get.
FAQ
Are you going to lose any more weight?
My plastic surgeon has recommended I go down to 185, but no lower. At that point I should be focused on more of a recomp. As you can see from the pictures, there is still fat under the skin. I need to get rid of as much of that as I can.
Did you have surgery or use any drugs/medicine/chemicals?
​No. Nothing against them, I just feel the ""quick"" (but, clearly not painless) methods available lack a certain educational value to them. Sure, I can teach someone the techniques to keep off the 100lbs they lost from weight loss surgery, but actually living it for years, dealing with failures/obstacles, is nearly always the best teacher.
What's next?
I'd still like to climb a mountain. Maybe Mt. Rainier or Mt. Elbert?​ Something with proper snow and requires a bit of technical climbing.​ I'v​e ​always been a bit of an armchair mountaineer. A friend of mine climbed Kilimanjaro about a year after a dual cervical fusion, plus he is 12 years older than me, so what is and isn't possible for me kind of has been thrown out the window.
Did you ever consider suicide?
I put this on every update I do, or anything I post connected with weight loss. The answer is yes I have, on a few occasions, not my finest moments.
If you are considering suicide, PLEASE get help, there are lots of options for help, regardless of where you are in the world. You might think suicide will stop what you are currently feeling, but it also robs you of everything you could be. In the US you can call 1-800-273-8255, 911, or go to the nearest Emergency Room.

my progress pictures
on
/r/Brogress
yesterday, I got so many nice comments that I thought to write about this journey in more detail here.
Initial motivation
My starting weight was 62kg (137lbs) and height 185cm (6'1"") at 20 years old, I didn't grow taller but I grew my physique and the way I live.
I always wanted to go to the gym, I browsed
4chan's /fit/
/r/fitness
and
/r/bodybuilding
a lot but never really got around to it. There was a gym in my town but it was quite expensive €65 per month for 1 free weight area and a stupid
milon circle?
..
Moving to England
Almost 2 years ago, I moved to the UK (Swindon) and they had a 24 hour gym. I thought, no more excuses and let's go. Browsing reddit and other forums I decided to start with Stronglifts 5x5.
Stronglifts 5x5
This was a great workout to start with, I did it for 3 months straight, never missing a single workout and gained a lot, the beginning is always fast. In those 3 months I went from 62kg (137lbs) to 70kg (155lbs). I got my bench up to 60kg, deadlift 120kg, row 70kg and OHP 45kg. I was
over the moon
, I felt stronger, shirts started to fit tighter and people started to notice slightly
Diet
: My diet at that time consisted of.. eating a ton of food and whole milk (GOMAD). I didn't count calories (still don't) but I always checked what pasta had the most calories, what meat etc. That and the additional 2000kcal I got from drinking 2.5L whole milk a day had me gaining a lot of weight. I stopped doing GOMAD after my skin started to get bad (a lot of pimples) and I had to go to the toilet about every hour.
PHUL
After feeling
fairly
strong and done with Stronglifts, I started
PHUL
. 4 days a week. I did this for about 3 months and again, saw some nice gains. Switching up routines has worked really well for me. After ~3 months I just don't get sore anymore, so I change workouts and then I do. I did this workout up until like 76kg (167lbs).
Diet:
During these 3 months, I again, ate as much as possible. I was completely done with the milk but started taking weight gainer shakes. I bought the
Optimum Nutrition
one and took one before bed, every night.
PHAT
After not getting sore anymore from PHUL, I started
PHAT
. 5 days a week, training hard. I did this for about 4 months and saw decent results. I got up to 80kg (176lbs), my goal weight. You know what happens once you reach your goal? You feel great, but you want more (or at least I do). So the current goal then was (and still is now) 90kg (200lbs).
Diet:
Nothing special, still kept up the weight gainer shakes every night and just ate
a lot
.
Moving back to the Netherlands
My year in England was done, I wanted to move back. It was as if the god Brodin himself wanted me to keep getting gains because in my tiny town, there suddenly was a brand new, shiny
24h
gym. This couldn't be a coincidence.
6 day PPL split
I started with 3 days a week, went up to 4 days a week, moved to 5 days a week so now the most logical next step to me was to go 6 days a week. So I did with this
6 day PPL split
. I had been lifting for almost a year now and people told me I looked like I lift..
Achievement Unlocked
-> Not looking DYEL anymore, finally. So I did this 6 days a week, again never skipping a workout and religiously going, looking forward to every day.
Diet:
Same old, just eat a lot. I moved back with my parents so I don't decide what's for dinner anymore... I got tired of the weight gainer shakes so I found something even better. ""quark"" with wallnuts.  I can't find the direct English word for it but it looks like
this
, it's like really thick yoghurt. One 500ml cup with wallnuts contains about 1050kcal and again, I took one before bed, every night.
Lazar Angelov's workout + Running
I started this workout a month ago, when I was 83kg (182lbs) and I am at the time of writing, 85.5kg (189lbs).
This workout
is a lot of fun and has muscle group days rather than pull / push days. Which is nice after ~10 months doing PPL. Before starting this workout I took a week off lifting because I had been lifting non stop. I hated not lifting and not going to the gym. Every hour I was thinking about the weights, looking at
/r/bodybuilding
, images of Steve Cook and Calum von Moger.. After that week I started the workout and man, I got super sore (again)!
Running
: So my new job was on the 4th floor, I take the elevator every day because Dom told me cardio kills gainz. I took the stairs ""for fun"" once and noticed my endurance sucked big time. Since Lazar's workout is 5 days a week, I got 2 rest days. That's 1 too much so I started running. Just 5-8km every Sunday.
Diet:
Same as with the PPL split, living the quark and wallnuts still.
Supplements
I took protein shakes, BCAAs, ZMA, whatever. None of them longer than 2 weeks because I just didn't dig the shakes. The only supplements I have taken daily and will continue to do so are:
Creatine (3g)
Multivitamin
Fish Oil
I feel like that's all I need, 5 pills when I wake up (multi + fish oil) and 1 scoop of creatine before I go to bed.
Sleep
8 hours a night, every night. I know and feel sleep is important. My new job requires me to get up at 05:45. This is why I am in bed 21:45 Sunday to Thursday. I religiously sleep 8 hours at least and about 8.5-9 in the weekend.
No alcohol
This is an overstatement, I sure drank some pints in England with my colleagues but only 1 night a week. If I drank Friday, I didn't drink on Saturday and vice-versa. I barely drink
any
alcohol nowadays as it just doesn't taste as good anymore. I used to love drinking beer with my friends but now I just drink water, only water.
Conclusion
Starting to lift has been the best decision in my life. I was always that skinny kid with red hair. I was scared of confrontation and I just felt weak. Now 1.5 years later people tell me I'm ""getting big"" and ""starting to look like a closet"" (that probably sounds cooler in Dutch). Someone in that
/r/brogress
thread told me I inspired him (or her). That was really cool to hear. I hope to inspire more people and that's why I wrote this long ass post.
EDIT:
I don't know why my post got locked but I didn't do it. Thanks for the nice PMs everyone and yes I like this manbun for now, I'm not going to cut it off because a few internet strangers tell me to haha!
EDIT2: 
Some of you have asked my Instagram / Snapchat, it's the same as my reddit username but I don't post a lot. Just the occasional gym selfie..
EDIT3: 
So it went kinda viral,
The LAD Bible posted it on Facebook
. My Reddit friends tell me I look like a cool viking and Facebook people call me out on the hair (which I wear because I like it) and are super mean. <3 for you guys.",

So about 2 and half to 3 years ago I weighed about 366lbs. It sucked. I had been fat my entire life and always wanted to change it. I wanted to change because for one its unhealthy to be that size. I had zero confidence. I wanted to be in the military and one day be a police officer or firefighter/paramedic but I wasn't going to get there being fat. There are plenty of reasons I can rattle off for my obesity but it all comes down to laziness and ignorance to nutrition.
So 2.5 years ago my uncle got me into lifting (forcefully lol). We'd lift almost everyday after I got up around 3pm (I worked 3rd shift). We'd lift for a few hours and before I knew it I had to get ready for work soon. So I had only a small window of time to eat and chill out versus waking up and eating/chilling all day then going to work. A month went by and I finally weighed myself. I lost 6 pounds and figured to myself that I might as well keep this up... and that's what happened. I found out about calorie counting which made my progress even better and taught me how to eat (I honestly had zero clue about the whole energy in vs energy out stuff). Then I found reddit and
r/fitness
and took in lots of info from here and just applied all the basics from the FAQ + other things, 2.5 years go by and boom! I'm fit enough to go to recruit training so I do, and I accomplish a huge goal!
Thats all I can think to write right now so feel free to ask questions!

fitness,https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/cg9c8d/the_absolute_beginners_guide_to_the_gym/,11096,408,The Absolute Beginner's Guide to the Gym,"Hello all,
​
First, this is not a post about exercise. This is a post about going to a gym!
I notice that every once in a while someone asks a question about gyms: joining them, using them, etiquette, etc. I also noticed that there isn't much about using or accessing gyms in the wiki, so hopefully this gets added (or not, if it's not useful). If you're new to getting in shape and want to use a gym for that, I hope this will answer any questions you may have.
This is based on my personal experience, and I'm sure many of you will have ""but my gym doesn't do it this way"" comments, so please feel free to comment and I'll adjust accordingly. Without further ado, let's talk about gyms!
​
What and why
A gym is a place that makes working out easier. It's usually a space dedicated to some form of physical activity that allows members to reach their fitness goals. Gyms vary quite drastically in what they offer, how they offer it, what they prioritize, etc. While you don't have to join a gym to get active or hit your fitness goals, it usually gives you access to equipment and resources you can't get otherwise (like weights, cardio equipment, pools, personal trainers, etc.). Unless you're hitting a specific exercise (running or swimming, for example), joining a gym is an easy way to get access to those resources.
Different gyms will prioritize different aspects of fitness and well-being. Most large gyms are all-rounders: they try to cater to weightlifters, bodybuilders, yoga enthusiasts, swimmers, runners, etc. Some gyms are more specialized: for example, some may have weights only. Or some might be single function (and probably not be called a gym at all): wall-climbing, yoga studios, Pilates studios, etc. What you join should depend on your goals, and this guide will cover as much as possible to help you decide and navigate the gyms.
​
What you would find at the gym
The reception
: almost without fail, there will be a desk at the front where someone will greet you and check that you're a member before letting you in. The people at the front desk are sometimes also trained as sales people, so they might try to sell you stuff, but once you're a member, they're there to help you out.
Free weights
: this will be one of the the most common items you'll find in gyms. The most basic weight option will probably be a
rack of dumbbells
, but you'll also see free weights,
Olympic barbells
, benches,
racks
, and all sorts of muscular
individuals
hauling these weights around. The variety and scale of equipment depends on the clientele, with some gyms having a much bigger area dedicated to weightlifting.
Resistance
machines
: these vary greatly in variety and function. Most will have some sort of weight selection, and they will mostly focus on one muscle or muscle group in the workout. While not very popular in
r/Fitness
, they do serve a function and are sometimes necessary (for example, they're good for back exercises). Some of them will have
cables
, some will have complex
levers
, and almost all will have a small
guide
on how to adjust the machine, how to use it, and which muscles it targets.
Cardio
equipment
: these are typically
treadmills
, elliptical machines, stationary bikes, rowing machines, and other devices that allow you to perform cardiovascular exercises without changing your location. They'll more often than not be seen in rows, usually opposite the windows or mirrors. As their name suggests, they help get your heart-rate up. They're probably the easiest to use, as you probably can run or cycle.
Body-weight and suspension area
: better equipped gyms might also have an area that seems somewhat emptier and allows for more freedom of movement, but might have a device like this
suspension rack
, and might have the big bouncy balls, or thick ropes attached to racks. These areas are designed for body-weight exercises, and will often attract personal trainers or even small group classes in ""
bootcamp
"" format.
Studios
: a
studio
is an area that is somewhat separated from the rest of the gym, usually by glass walls and doors, usually has mirrors on one side, and will sometimes have a stage. Studios are used for things like yoga classes, group exercise classes, etc. You might find yoga mats or exercise balls in there. Some are specialized: they might cycling studios or Pilates studios. Studios are usually open to members if there isn't an active class, and they're good for stretching or warming up/cooling down.
Specialized equipment
: some gyms have climbing walls, swimming pools, etc. It's worth asking about these if anything interests you.
Group exercise classes
: many gyms offer these classes (Les Mills, Spinning, yoga, Pilates, etc.). These are sometimes part of your membership, and are sometimes extra. You should check with your gym on if they have them and how you can sign up.
Gender-specific areas
: other than the obvious ones (showers and bathroom) some gyms might have female-only areas: could be a class, could be a studio, could be a certain time in the week. If you're female and would a ""safer"" environment, you can always ask about these
Showers & sauna
: most gyms will have lockers, changing rooms, showers, and some will have hair dryers, ironing boards, saunas, steam rooms, jacuzzis, etc. These are not important to everyone, but a shower might be worth confirming if you're planning on showering after a workout. Many gyms will also offer towels (a small one to carry around and a big one to dry yourself after showering).
Personal trainers
: as the name suggests, these individuals dedicate their time to just you in the gym! PT sessions are usually an hour to 90-minutes each, and are designed to help you focus and get better results. PTs are not for everyone. First, they're expensive. Second, they need you to agree on a predefined time and place to exercise. Third, you might not need them if you've been doing this for a while. However, they can be good if you're an absolute noob and prefer someone to handhold you for the first month or so. PT sessions are sold by the # of sessions, and can used over a specific period. Check with your gym on what options they may have.
Chillout area
: some of the nicer gyms will have a lounge area, with coffee, a juice bar, etc. available to the members. This isn't really related to exercise, but having an area like that makes a gym more appealing to some.
​
Cool, sound like fun! Where do I start?
First, find a convenient gym. I highly suggest a place that is either near work or near home; anything too far will lead to excuses for not going. You also need to make sure your gym has the equipment/timing/price that's good for you. Google is your friend (and I guess Yelp). Once you have one or two options, head down before the day you intend to start working out. Walk up to the reception and ask them for a tour of the facilities, and about their pricing options. I suggest you go the gym around the time you intend to work out, to see how busy it is. Don't forget to see the showers and lockers. Before signing up for a long-term contract, see if you can get a test run (some will give you a 3 day trial, some have one-month options). A one-month option helps you see if a gym is really for you (some people will always prefer to run/cycle/swim outdoors). If there are several gyms that are convenient location-wise, I suggest you see them all before signing any commitments.
A small note: while in general gyms and gym-goers are welcoming, some gym environments could be toxic (judgmental, show-offy, superficial). Don't be discouraged! That's why I suggest trying a gym out for a month, to make sure the environment is positive and supportive. You need to find a place that you'll be happy going to.
Second, once you've settled on the gym, get ready on the day you want to go. Wear some comfortable clothes and shoes, pack a change of clothes (if you need to change), a bottle of water, and head to the gym (I wouldn't initially worry about things like gloves or wraps; you won't need those for a while). At the reception, check in and ask for a towel (if the gym provides it), and ask for help for whatever you're trying to do: if it's weights, ask them for help with the weight area, cardio, ask for help with the machines, etc. The staff should be able to orient you and give you the basics of the gym. Ask about any special rules (use of chalk, grunting, music, etc., some have funny rules). At this point you should follow whatever program you've researched before. Remember, this is not a working out guide!
Third: shower and change, and congrats! day one is done! Keep in mind that a gym is not the cleanest of environments, so make sure you also wash your bottle, etc.
​
Gym etiquette
The most important thing you need to keep in mind is that no one in the gym cares about what you look like, how much you weight, and what exercises you perform.
Having said that, a gym is a common area, so it pays to be considerate. While exercising, observe the room. See how people wait for machines to be ready, how they behave, etc. Look for signs that talk about rules (for example, some gyms limit cardio machine usage ). If you're unsure about something, ask. Unless they're in the middle of their workout, most people are more than happy to help. The gym staff are there to help, so always feel free to ask them as well.
Weights
: if you're weightlifting, you're going to rest between sets. If the gym is busy, it is good form to share: other people can use the machines/devices/weights while you're resting between sets. Racks (squat, bench) get busy and sharing helps everyone move more quickly. Quick note: if you're sharing equipment/machines, and you're listening to music, male sure you take your headphones/earphones off so you can communicate. You need to hear your buddy. This is especially important if you're ever spotting someone.
If you're using a bench or a seat, it's good form to place a towel where you might sweat on it, and wipe it down after you're done. Before grabbing weights from a machine/bar, check to see if someone is still using them (asking won't harm). Always return your weights to the weight rack. Don't be the disruptive asshole (grunting loudly, dropping weights). If you're unsure about something, or need help with an exercise, ask other people who are not actually working out. The big buff guys are probably the nicest as they usually remember what it was like being a beginner.
Some seasoned lifters in here pointed out that dropping weights and grunting are part of the workout. That's very true, but doesn't mean you get to be an asshole about it. Is there rubber on the floor? Is there a deadlift area? Are you grunting in effort or to show off? Again, it's really about being considerate.
Cardio
: observe the time limit if there are people waiting, and wipe your sweat off when you're done.
Studio use
: return everything you use in there. Turn off the lights if necessary. Don't drop weights on the wooden floor.
Body weight area
: make sure there isn't a class or someone else using the equipment. If it's an individual, ask if sharing is ok. If it's a class, either join in/sign up, or wait for it to finish.
Group classes
: these usually need you sign up early, and your membership needs to include them. Always put your equipment away after the class is done, or wipe your sweat puddle. Think of people using the gym after you.",

(Female @140lb bodyweight)","Yesterday I hit a 455lb / 207kg deadlift, which brought my total up to 1,002lb. I am super psyched! When I started out I couldn't even imagine this was even possible. Bodyweight between 137 and 140lb (~63kg).
Videos of lifts
Squat 347lb / 157.5kg + stiff bar comp deadlift of 435lb / 197.5kg
Bench 200lb / 90.7kg
Deadlift 455lb / 207kg on deadlift bar
Past Training
I've been lifting off and on since the summer of 2011, so about 6.5 years. I started powerlifting training specifically in the fall of 2013, my 1st powerlifting meet was summer 2014 after reddit told me I was actually pretty good and should compete, lol. I was 110lb / 50kg when I started lifting.
I was self coached up until this past summer when I started working with RTS and Mike.
I did starting strength my 1st year of powerlifting but stalled out around the time I did my 1st meet. My numbers were S:245 B:135 D:335 @120lb bodyweight. After that, I switched to a PPL x2 that I wrote. I did that for another year and a half till my lifts were around S: 275 B:150 D:405. I then started an upper/lower split where I did bench 2x a week and squat + deadlifts 2x a week but I alternated which I focused on as the main lift. I was on that until I started coaching with RTS. My lifts were S:315 B:175 D:425 and bodyweight was 128 out of comp.
Current Training
I decided to go up a weight class at that time, from 125 (57kg) to 138 (63kg). I am 5'5 so I was doing myself a huge disservice competing in the 57kg class where everyone else was a half foot smaller than me. Since going up 4 months ago, my lifts have increased dramatically and so has my wilks! RTS had me on an upper/lower split similar to my old one till I competed at USAPL Raw Nationals last month.
Since Nationals, I have been on a full body routine 4x a week, with a bench variation each workout as well as a squat or deadlift variation and accessories. The volume each workout is low to make up for the high frequency. It took my joints and muscles about 3 weeks to get used to the frequency. I seem to be handling it ok now.
The deadlift PR was a total YOLO move on my part and not programmed at all :). I wanted to play with the deadlift bar. This was my 2nd time ever using one, with the 1st being back in 2014.

Diet
Pretty relaxed. I suck at eating so my #1 goal is just getting my calories. I maintain around 2200-2500. My #2 goal is getting enough protein. I aim for 100g bare minimum and 160g+ when I am prepping for a comp. For supplements, I use protein powder and sometimes take creatine. I take a multivitamin, fish oil, vitamin D, zinc, magnesium, and melatonin every night before bed.",

I occasionally post progress pictures on IG if you'd like to follow me - @austin.sure
Started at 275lbs and now down to 170!
Here's the breakdown of how this actually went down. To begin, this picture is from when I had already lost 50 pounds (so around 210-220).
The first 50 pounds was lost 100% through using a keto diet paired with strict calorie counting. I kept my daily calorie intake around 1400-1600 per day and it took approximately 4 months to shed the first 50 pounds. Again, no exercise was used, barely even walks around the neighborhood.
The next 50-60 pounds, I decided I'd like to speed things up a bit so I implemented running around my neighborhood paired with some light dumbbell training. Mainly just 15 pound dumbbells and different variations of chest presses, curls, tricep extensions, etc. This got me all the way down to 160 pounds. Now was the time to actually build up muscle and by this point I was 3 years into the process.
So for the last 5 years I've kept the same workouts and have progress. I have been running PHAT (Power Hypertrophy Adaptive Training). It's a 5 day a week workout program that I stuck to religiously and over the past 5 years I can count on both my hands the amount of workouts I actually missed.
Instead of typing out the workout, I used this spreadsheet here:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z88d0BCV7jDOyPouLc5TzYjAqY9u_p8ZnTmDkaABACE/edit#gid=0
I have gone through 5 years of bulking and cutting cycles and have finally reached the body I want.
If anyone has any questions about any of my struggles along the way, please reach out and I'll try my hardest to help!
As for diet, it was strictly an IIFYM approach. I did this 100% through calorie counting!!! No BS fad diets or anything. I ate what I wanted, when I wanted, but as long as I was under my caloric goals for the day (around 1600-1800 for cutting, 2800-3000 for bulking) I always saw results.

Before and After Photos
(TLDR):
Weight:
215lbs —> 155 lbs
(That’s 97.5kg down to 70.3kg)
Time Period:
Technically 3 years of weight loss (explained in post) but the most dramatic changes happened in the past year. I started lifting in May of 2017.
Lift Progress Summary:
DL:       95lbs -–> 295x3 (275x5)
Squat:  75lbs —> 265x5
Bench: 105lbs –> 185x3 (175x5)
OHP:    65lbs —> 115x5
Never did 1-rep Maxes. These are just the highest lifts I’ve recorded in the gym.
Most of these are from a few months ago when I weighed a few more pounds and my lifting routine was more ‘consistent.’ My lifts are a bit lower now.
Program:
For the most part, I based it on
u/metallicadpa
’s PPL Program. It’s available in the ‘recommended routines’ in this subreddit’s wiki.
EDIT: A lot of folks in the comments asked for a link to the PPL program. Here it is:
https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/
Disclaimer: I didn’t truly follow this program as prescribed. And to be honest, if I had stuck to this program more strictly, I’m sure I would’ve seen a lot better results. It’s very effective. But for a variety of life/personal reasons combined with some fuckarounditis, it wouldn’t be fair to the creator to say that I ‘actually’ followed his program for a full year. Nonetheless, I’m pretty happy with my progress so far and I owe a lot to this program for giving me my foundation.
Diet
As for Diet, I just tracked my calories with MyFitnessPal.
The specifics of what I ate are not too important - but the act of counting calories consistently is the single most important thing I did in this entire journey.
Yes daily calorie-tracking is tedious. Yes it sucks. But that’s exactly why so many people fail at weight loss. If you want the results bad enough, you’ll do it.
Anyway - A typical day of eating might look like this:
-I skip breakfast most days. I guess this means I “intermittent fast.” It works for me because I’m not hungry in the morning and I’m always very hungry after work / in the evening.
Lunch (~420 calories)
Turkey sandwich on thin wheat
*
Sliced orange/yellow bell peppers
Dannon Light/Fit Greek Yogurt
I like to meal prep this on Sundays so it’s basically on auto-pilot.
Dinner: (1000-1100 calories)
Chicken Breast - 8-12oz
Small/healthy microwaveable meals, usually with Chicken (think weight watchers, healthy choice, etc)
Steamed Vegetables
A few cups of Greek Yogurt
Also coffee and water. Copious amounts of black coffee and water.
PREFACE:
First, this is probably not the most dramatic transformation you’ll ever read. But this roughly marks 1 year of ‘getting my shit’ together so it seems like a fitting time for a progress post. So much has changed for me in the last year, between work, life, fitness, and more - and most of it started with discovering the
r/fitness
community a year ago. So it felt like the right time to post something.
Second, while this post is not about video games - some sections will talk about them in-detail. I’ll try to mark the sections as skippable for the non-gaming audience here. But I think there are a lot of folks, specifically gamers, who might be in a similar situation to the ‘old’ me. So I’m leaving those details in this story for folks who might be in a similar phase of their fitness journey to where I used to be.
Lastly, I’ll note that I don’t believe video games are inherently ‘bad’ (I still enjoy them a lot from time to time). It’s just that in my case, my old approach to games reinforced a very problematic and sedentary lifestyle. A lifestyle that I’m now happy to be rid of.
Alright, let’s begin -
Background / How I got fat
I’ve actually been out of shape for most of my life.  I almost never exercised or thought at all about the consequences of what I was eating. I typically ate whatever was either convenient or tasted good without ever thinking about what I was putting into my body.
Growing up, I never had any athletic sports that I was passionate about, but I definitely did have a ‘competitive drive.’ My main hobby growing up was playing video games - a hobby that i’ve loved since as long as I could remember holding a SNES controller in my hands. As I got older, this ‘drive’ manifested itself in my gaming experience. Starting with Halo, then Starcraft 2 (hey look at my reddit name), then eventually League of Legends and more - the drive kept me hooked on games. I was determined to get better.
The positive side - is that I developed some helpful habits that helped me to get decently good at games. I had the discipline to constantly self-criticize my own play, refine my technique, and learn from gaming professionals in order to get better than my peers and improve.
But this ‘drive’ mindset was a double-edged sword. While the ‘focus’ was certainly valuable, I realize now that I was actually extremely narrow-minded. I ignored many other critical aspects of my life in favor of competitive improvement. It took me a long time to realize this. Snapping out of it - really all began here with
r/fitness
.
College - The Weight-Gain Train
When I went to college, everything got worse...waaaaaaay worse. My newfound ‘freedom’ led to increased consumption of junk food, much more heavy drinking. I basically realized I could eat Pizza and Chipotle whenever I wanted. So I did just that.
I was also a chronic procrastinator and had a very unhealthy approach to academics. It would not be uncommon to find me in a computer lab procrastinating until 2:30am, ordering a pizza, and then finally doing my assignment. Despite spending hours constantly procrastinating or gaming, I always told myself “I didn’t have the time to workout” because I was constantly behind on schoolwork.
This led to a significant weight gain (I know, shocker!). But I got better at games - which was all I really cared about.
Post-Graduation
When I graduated I weighed about 215lbs. I gained more than 40 pounds while in my 4 years at school.
Now that I had graduated and had a full-time job, I ‘said’ enough is enough and tried to refine some of my bad habits. I cut out major diet offenders. No more late night pizza orders. No more soda or energy drinks. Yes I’d still frequently eat junk food for dinner and didn’t track my calories, but I forced myself to at least eat a healthier lunch.
And I began running. God this sucked at first. I remember I couldn’t run a single damn mile. Not even close. I was wheezing and drooping in sweat in less than a half-mile. But I just kept going to a local park after work and made running part of my routine.  Gradually the distance increased substantially.
All these new habits took me a long way. I lost quite a bit of weight (at least 20lbs). I was feeling good about it. Eventually even tried on my old suit and my crazy long sleeves made me feel like one of those inflatable ‘arm flailing’ tube men that you see in front of grand openings. Success (or so I thought).
But eventually the progress stopped. The weight loss halted. It happened because it got harder and I wasn’t actually pushing myself. I wasn’t really trying.
And I also still poured almost every free moment I had into video games...
From Gaming to Fitness
This section probably won’t make any sense to anyone who doesn’t play competitive video games so you can SKIP this section and jump to ‘EPIPHANY’ if that’s not your cup-of-tea.
But failing to get promoted into Diamond league in League of Legends might’ve been one the best things that ever happened to me. Let me attempt to explain.
I was not just a casual gamer. I always strived to be competitive. I always wanted to be the best (or at least constantly getting better). I was addicted to seeing myself improve. In order to make that happen, I developed a sense of discipline and practice that helped me to climb decently fast. I won’t pretend I was a League ‘God’ or anything. There are many better players than me. But I eventually climbed to top 2% in North America. I also co-launched and hosted a weekly podcast related to teaching people how to improve at the game (shoutout to anyone from Tforce/4wards who might be reading this) and I gave individual coaching/lessons. And that was all while working a full-time job with a 1.5hour commute, often playing half as many ranked games as many of my similarly-ranked peers.
Now I attribute my rapid climb to my discipline & focus combined with my ‘drive.’ No matter how high I climbed, I was a constant student of the game. I learned from watching Korean pro players who were way better than me. I’d spend hours breaking down what they did to be successful and trying to apply it to my own play. I constantly ‘drilled’ myself in somewhat repetitive tasks and game mechanics until it was almost sub-conscious to me. I regularly reviewed my play, or when I’d make mistakes and was very critical of myself because I wanted to get better.
And I climbed because…I wanted it. I wanted it bad. I worked really hard at it. I was driven. But as anyone who has played the game knows - many folks don’t truly care about their rank until the season is about to end. Until there’s a deadline that they have to address. That was me (remember I mentioned I was a procrastinator?).
At the very end of season 6 of league of legends, I decided to “push myself” to get into Diamond - but I had waited way too long to start. As the deadline approached, I dropped nearly everything else in my life to focus on climbing. I basically sat at my computer all day grinding games, practicing technique, or reviewing replays. Eat, sleep, game, repeat. I put in a ton of work and saw a tremendous amount of progress in a short period of time…
But...it didn’t happen. I ran out of time. The weekend before the season ended, I was a single victory away from winning a promotion series that would have granted me my coveted “diamond border” multiple times. But I didn’t make it. I was crushed.
Why do I mention this all this gaming nonsense? I swear it connects back to fitness. Here we go.
When I didn’t make it to Diamond, my first instinct was to get the climb out of the way early in Season 7. I was already practically there - so I thought “this will be a piece of cake.” With this mindset I became lazy. I cut a lot of corners that helped me to climb in the first place and eventually started falling in rank. I realized that if I wanted to see the type of progress I needed to climb quickly again - I was going to have to invest every ounce of my free time and energy into this game again…
…And then that thought filled me with dread.
EPIPHANY
Wait. why? Why should I work so hard for this?
Now knowing how grueling my experience would be to get back to another Diamond promotion series with my old approach to the game - I asked myself - how could I possibly justify it? I would have to give up every free moment of my life to get a shiny border on a loading screen for internet bragging rights.
I decided that I’d be better off putting my time and efforts into something else. I hypothesized that if I put half as much effort into any other aspect of my life as I did trying to climb in video games - that I could see tremendous results. So I decided to test that theory…with fitness.
I then quit playing ranked league altogether, took a “before” photo - and then read the
r/fitness
wiki.
Foray into fitness - 1 Year Ago
Many initial struggles. I was terrified of attempting compound lifting movements at they gym. But I also knew they were important. I watched a bunch of YouTube videos on proper form and read a bunch of articles on diet. Most importantly - I read through the
r/fitness
wiki. Multiple times.
I settled on doing
u/metallicadpa
’s PPL routine. And I started counting my calories strictly.
A month later - wow.
2 months and some beginner gains later -
Holy shit.
This actually works.
I realized that if you truly work at something with persistence and  discipline day-in and day-out - then the seemingly impossible suddenly becomes possible. And I was never the same again.
Transforming my Life
With all this extra time I had saved from not grinding video games - it quickly became apparent that I should pick up some new hobbies and practices.
I picked up rock climbing to stay active. I got back into playing guitar -which I hadn’t played in years. I pushed myself to be more social and outgoing after years of sitting inside a room playing games until 2am  nearly every evening. Soon my whole life felt very different.
Over the course of the next year:
WORK - I got promoted, and also joined an awesome new team recently. They’re the best.
SOCIAL - I made new friends, re-kindled old friendships, and ‘hung out’ with people way more than when I was grinding games. I shifted from my narrow-minded self that was only concerned with video games, who struggled to relate to people —> to being genuinely interested in other people and their passions. It’s been a massive life-changer.
LIVING - I gradually transitioned from a recent college grad with student-loan debt living with his parents to an adult who is living debt-free in one of the most incredible cities in the world.
PRODUCTIVITY, PROCRASTINATION, & STRESS - I realized that a lot of the stress I had and procrastination could be avoided by applying proper discipline and planning. By writing things down and properly managing my time with discipline day-in and day-out, I often work half as hard as I used to and achieve 5-10x times the results in terms of productivity. I often think back on how much stress I had during school with procrastination, and I now think I could easily get way better grades with half the amount of ‘effort.’
TRAVEL - Last year I went on a two-week Euro-trip with my friends and it was one of the best experiences of my life. This
photo from Norway
has one of my best genuine smiles. I love doing active & outdoor activities now. I am planning to travel more in the coming months.
A brief note regarding fitness, girls, and confidence:
A lot of people get into fitness to attract the opposite sex (or same sex). It was certainly a ‘motivating factor’ for me initially.
And yes - the gains have helped :)
But really, the added confidence I gained from smiling at myself in the mirror in the morning, combined with developing a more broad range of hobbies & interests - did way more for my dating life than just fitness alone. If I just replaced my obsession with gaming with an obsession with fitness - I doubt I would be as happy as I am now.
Looking forward
I’ve never really “bulked” before. I’m eager to see where I could be after a full bulk-cut cycle. But right now, fitness has taken a bit of a back-seat compared to some other priorities in my life. That said, I’m looking to start my first true ‘bulk’ sometime in the late fall, most likely November.
For now, I’ll continue my weekly ritual of eating at a deficit during the week so that I can enjoy the weekends without as much guilt and still say ‘somewhat’ lean. I’m probably not going to have a 6 pack at this rate (not willing to give up alcohol and other delicious weekend foods right now). Admittedly, that was a pretty hard pill to swallow initially but I’ve come to terms with it. That said, I lead a pretty active lifestyle and I don’t anticipate I’ll get too out of shape either. And then I’ll reign it all in and get ‘strict’ again once I start my bulk so it doesn’t get too out of control.
Tips / advice that helped me
-
Read the wiki.
I know that this is beaten to death here, but seriously do it. It’s probably the most important thing related to fitness that I’ve ever read.
-Consistency is everything. Fuck “motivation.” This is about consistently about getting your ass in the gym and watching your diet. Even on days when you really don’t want to.
-Once you lose some weight - remember to buy new clothes that fit you. Seriously makes a big difference.
-Meal prep on Sundays. Eat copious amounts of Chicken & Greek Yogurt. Drink plenty of Black Coffee.
Special Thanks
-This community. Especially progress posters. You gave me the reinforcement I needed. Thank you.
-Thanks to
u/metallicadpa
for writing the PPL program.
-And special thanks to the mods who keep this place up and running
Lastly I’ll just say this:
If you decide you want it bad enough, that’s literally all it takes. Fitness is not complicated.
There’s no magical barrier from preventing you from succeeding. Ignore any dumb voice or excuse in your head. It’s all bullshit.
Seriously, your results are yours, and they are there for the taking. Just start.",

Hi everyone, in 3.5 years of training I've found a few resources that have benefited me and I hope they will be of some benefit to you too. I compiled them into a few categories for readability. I am biased in what I chose as a Strongman, but even so I hope most people get something out of this. Even if you've read most of these, now the links are all in one place.
Enjoy and Happy Lifting!

Male / 5'6"" / 43 yrs
Started @ 155lbs
Current @ 134
90 Day Transformation - BEFORE AND AFTER PHOTOS
DIET
I started by cutting out sugar and sodas.
I substitute sugar with stevia.
I stated my macros with a 40/35/25 split of carbs/protein/fat.
I choose this macro to ensure I was consuming enough protein in order to minimize muscle loss.
I made sure to eat approx 0.85 to 1 gram of protein per 1lb of lean muscle mass in order to minimize muscle loss while dropping weight.
When I first started getting serious, I was 155 @ 24% Body Fat. That means I had 118 lbs of lean body muscle (LBM) and 37lbs of fat.
Therefore, I would consume 120 grams of protein which is approx 480 calories. The rest of my calories would go into carbs and fat.
I'm a very busy parent and making sure I was consuming enough protein was a challenge. So to help out I would drink approx 2 protein shakes daily, one for breakfast and another with dinner. I usually added bananas or other fruits.
Sometimes I use peanut butter powder. I hate water in my shakes and found using Silk Almond Milk sugar free only had 30 calories per 8 oz. Worked great as a milk substitute.
Lunch usually consisted of oatmeal with cinammon and stevia with some Silk Almond Milk. These were my main carbs for the day.
Dinner included a lot of kale salads with veggies. I often added tomatoes, cucumbers, sliced carrots, radishes, etc..
Sometimes I'd add tuna or chicken breast if I needed to mix it up or hit my protein target. Salad dressings were mostly fat free or low calorie (approx 30-60 calories per 2 tablespoons).
Sides included microwaved baby red potatoes with some country crock, salt and pepper. These were great as I found my hunger would subside by eating potatoes and noticed the calorie to gram weight was a good balance compared to other types of carbs like chips, pretzels, popcorn or other snacks.
Snacks included nuts, plantain chips, orveille redenbacher smart pop popcorn, celery or an apple.
CALORIES
I made sure to calculate my daily Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) without workouts.
I then multiplied my TDEE by 7 to get my weekly calories so I knew how much I could consume for the week. I added 3500 to that number to get my maintenance calories. Subtracted 7000 calories so I could lose approx 2lbs per week and divided by 7 to get my daily calories.
So, at 155 lbs my TDEE was 1875. Weekly that was 13,125 calories. My total weekly workouts added another 4000-5000 calories for a total of 17,125 to 18,125 calories. From there I would subtract 7,000 calories to get a 2lb weekly weight loss. This meant I could only consume 11,125 weekly or approx 1,600 calories daily. However, it was important that I hit that 4000-5000 calorie weekly workout.
EXCERCISE
Starting around January 2019, I was almost 170 lbs, barely able to wear size 33 pants and really out of shape.
I started eating healthier by eating oatmeal, veggies, salads and less fast food. By April 2019, I dropped down to 160.
I started counting my steps with a tracker and targeted 10K steps per day. By June 2019 I was down to 155 where I plateaued for 6 weeks. That's when I got fed up at not making any more progress. Here's what happened next.
TOOLS
Garmin Vivoactive Smartwatch
Jump rope
Wahoo Heart Rate Monitor (HRM)
Food Scale
Weight Scale that calculates Fat Percentage
Tape measure
The smartwatch helps me track my daily steps and connects to the Wahoo HRM when I do activities where I don't want to risk damaging my phone (swimming, mud races, etc..)
Jump rope is probably the best tool in my arsenal. It's cheap and highly effective in burning calories efficiently.
Food scale is a must. I needed to know how much I was consuming so I could target how many calories I could eat on a weekly basis.
The weight scale with fat percentage calculation helped show that I was dropping fat % and not just weight.
Tape measure to help calculate body fat using online calculators.
SOFTWARE
MyFitnessPal calorie counter
Garmin Connect activity tracker
Polars Polarbeat activity tracker
SyncMytracks Pro (Android)
Strong (Android)
MyFitnessPal is AMAZING! I have it connected to my Garmin Connect Account where my workouts and steps are imported. From there I can see how I'm progressing. I can track my weight and upload photos as motivation. Seeing the progress via photos and graphs REALLY MOTIVATED me.
I also use Polars Polarbeat activity tracker for my workouts, primarily because I do heart rate training workouts. From there, SyncMytracks exports my workouts and imports them into Garmin Connect which uploads them to MyFitnessPal.

Ok, so I've learned A LOT over the last 3 months.
The BIGGEST TAKEAWAY is this... long periods of high intensity cardio is NOT the best for ""cutting"".
I learned that short HIIT sessions are MUCH more efficient and effective.
Here's my routines:
Morning workouts consist of 45 minutes of low intensity cardio. This included riding a bike and jump rope.
I would ride my bike and try to keep my heart rate around 115-135 BPM.For me that was approx 65-75% of my MAX HR. In this range, approx 25% of the calories I use/burn in my workout comes from fat which was my main target, not muscle growth.
After about 45 minutes, I would transition to a 10 minute HIIT routine where my heart rate is at 90% or more of my Max HR.
Afternoon workout consisted of strength training. This is where I would weight lift, low weights high reps and high sets for about 45 minutes.
I used the Strong Android app to track my workouts and see my progress.
I followed
this article
as my workout routine for weight-lifting/strength training routines. Very simple to follow.
That's pretty much it.
As of now, my goal is to hit 130 lbs @ 10% body fat then start a clean bulk program to build muscle mass. I have approx 2 weeks to go.
Hope this helps and if anyone has more questions feel free to ask.
EDIT:
WOW!!!! I did not expect this to blow up. Thank you kind strangers for my first gold and silver.
There are a lot of questions about diet, workouts, tools, etc....
I'll update with more details tonight. I've been answering by mobile so it's taking a long time to type this out. When I get home I'll update with more info soon as I get home.",
fitness,https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5pwxki/foam_rollers_and_lacrosse_balls_are_awesome/,8641,509,Foam rollers and lacrosse balls are awesome self-massage tools that can be used to practically relax your entire body. I love them so much I have made videos showing how I use them (and GIFs of them to save you time!),"What is a foam roller? How does it work?
A foam roller is a large, cylindrical self massage tool. You roll over this cylinder and the pressure of your own bodyweight helps to knead your muscles and relax large areas of your body. So, that's why I have one. It's like getting free massages for the rest of your life.
Link to video tutorial on how to use the foam roller.
Foam Rolling GIFs
I also made looping GIF's with my doggie to help save you time.
Upper Back
(avoid lower back; edit:
read here why
)
Neck
(not meant to be aggressive)
Calves
Shins
(lateral side to get anterior tibialis)
Quads / Hip Flexors
(bent legs and/or straight legs)
IT Band / VLO / Hip
Note:
I like to do 10 passes for each body part. However, you don't
have to
constantly roll back and forth. Sometimes, just putting pressure on ONE tender spot and holding it for 30-60sec is effective, too.
What is a lacrosse ball? How does it work?
When someone gives you a deep tissue massage, they use their palms/fingers/elbows to apply pressure to help relax tight muscles and make you feel better. A lacrosse ball is a fairly hard, dense ball about the size of a tennis ball that helps mimic this deep release massage with your own bodyweight. It allows for much more localized pressure than a foam roller.
Link to video tutorial on how to use a lacrosse ball.
The best part is that you could go to town on your
glutes and hamstrings
in a way that not even many massage-therapists will because of how intimate that area is. (When was the last time someone FIRMLY massaged your ASS? Right?)  So thats why I have one, to get free ass massages, haha. (No but seriously, it's great for the whole body.)
Lacrosse Ball GIFs
Again, I made GIF's with my doggie to help save time.
Gluteus Maximus
Piriformis
Hamstrings
(sit on hard surface and place under thigh)
Feet / Plantar Fascia
(hold onto something for balance)
Upper Back (Traps)
Triceps/Brachialis
Triceps alternative style
(tack ball and straighten/bend elbow)
Gluteus Medius
(Static, just chill over it)
Deltoids & Upper Chest against wall (no GIF of this, it's in the video tho and it's worth mentioning that you could do it)
Note: Instead of constantly just rolling over the parts in question, you could also statically hold against them and just breath and relax for 30-60seconds. This works extremely well for the glutes and triceps and many other areas.
Lacrosse Ball Alternatives
If you don't have a lacrosse ball, you could use a tennis ball, baseball, softball, billiard ball, cricket ball, floor hockey ball, golf ball, spalding bouncey ball as alternatives. They don't work as well as the lacrosse one in some cases, but it's better than nothing and sometimes it may even be better!
With the combination of a lacrosse ball and foam roller, I can practically massage most of my body and the best part is,
these don't take up much room and I could easily travel with them,
especially
the lacrosse ball. Happy rolling!

(37/M/6’3”/208lbs). Results, Pics, Thoughts, and The Rock’s Response.","Starting February 1, I began my “Rock’ing for 30 Days” challenge to eat and train like Dwayne Johnson for 30 days. As it ended on a Tuesday, I finished out the week, completing a total of 33 days of the challenge.
Three weeks ago,
I shared all the details about the eating and workout plan
, so I won’t repeat it here.
TL;DR SUMMARY
After eating 5300 calories a day for 33 days, more than 23 hours of cardio, and almost 80lbs of cod!, I gained a total of 1lb. After over 28 hours of weight training, I got leaner and gained some muscle in my upper arms (most triceps), upper legs (mostly quads), my upper chest (you can see it pulled my chest up). Here are the
before and after photos
.
THE ROCK’S RESPONSES
I blogged every day during this month and a few articles got written about the challenge. They came to the attention of The Rock, who had a few things to say on Twitter about it. He doubted me at first, but then came around.
Here are screengrabs of The Rock’s tweets
.
LIFTING RESULTS
I got stronger, though I hadn’t done much isolated lifting in years, so definitely a lot of beginner gains here. I probably increased weights around 10-15% or so. Just to pick two random exercises for an example:  In the beginning of the month, I started the incline bench at around 115lbs (4x12/10/8/6), and now it starts at 150lbs. I was originally doing the 200 reps of leg press at 160-180lbs, now it’s at 220-240lbs.
One change to the workout: in week 3, the lack of ab work became quite apparent, so I added 3 ab exercises: leg raises, russian twist, and stir the pot. More details are shown in the Google doc below.
SO NO WEIGHT GAIN?
Apparently not. I didn’t skip a single meal, ate every bite, and had nothing else besides this food the entire time. I thought I would put on a few pounds, so getting leaner was a surprise. I had never really subscribed to a pure “calories in, calories out” belief, and this experience killed it for me. It’s more than how much you eat, what you eat makes a huge difference.
Here’s a photo gallery showing meal prep
.
HOW I FELT ALL MONTH
Terrific. Even with so much food, I never felt overly full. Every morning I would do 50 mins of cardio, then eat 10oz of cod, 2 cups of oatmeal, and 2 hard boiled eggs (at the gym!) then weight train. I always used to work out on a mostly empty stomach (just a shake) so I thought this would make me nauseous, but it felt good.
Even with all the workouts, I never felt sore. All the food seemed to be fueling my recovery. Even the little aches and pains of being in your late 30’s went away. I also was serious about stretching/foam-rolling at the end of the workouts, so I didn’t feel very tight either.
WAS IT WORTH IT?
I decided to do this as a challenge to myself, to see if I had to discipline to wake up at 5am everyday, do all these workouts, prepare all this food in advance, eat every meal, have no cheating, and live my normal life. I have no aspirations to get huge like The Rock, and 30 days wouldn’t do it anyway. Overall, it was an extremely positive experience, and I highly encourage everyone to push themselves to try something new for a month.
If I had to do it over, the only change would be to take a ton of measurements, pictures, body scans, blood tests, etc beforehand. Would have been nice to quantify it more. There seems to have been a nice change in my body fat %, would have been great to have those numbers (anyone want to make estimates?).
Would I suggest this plan to others? If you’re chasing the physical results, you’re almost certainly better off putting together a routine and meal plan specifically for you. It’s also extremely expensive, at $42/day. While cod is an excellent source of low calorie, low fat protein, that benefit doesn’t outweigh the cost of, say, chicken breast.
WHAT IS WORTH INCORPORATING?
You could probably eat more, as long as it’s the right foods. Experiment with increasing your protein and overall calories with good, clean food, and see what happens.
This is personal preference, but I liked doing cardio first, then weights, which I had never done. It’s a good warmup, and it’s nice to be done for the day after you lift that last weight.
Mastering efficient food prep is key. Not having to decide what you’re eating at every meal is a pleasure, and not having to cook it. And with practice, you get a ton of return on your time investment. I can make 18 meals in about an hour now. I’ll keep prepping food every few days.
I have eaten mostly keto for years, but man, oatmeal is delicious. Starting every day with it moving forward.
WHAT’S NEXT
I want to follow a more sustainable version of this program for longer, starting with another 30 days. So far, I’m doing the same workouts 5x a week. I changed up the diet to have 5 meals, no cod, and comes in at 3579cal/451C/59F/294P. So far, I have noticed I’m getting a bit sore now, in a way I wasn’t before, so I’m going to keep experimenting here to come up with a better version. 
If there is interest in me sharing that diet, or putting up an update post after following a tweaked plan for 30 days, let me know. Or if anyone wants more detail on any specific piece of this, let me know.

As usual, don’t bother with media headlines -- this study is NOT a blow to low-carb dieting, which can be quite effective due to factors such as typically higher protein and more limited junk food options. Rather, this study shows that a low-carb diet isn’t necessary for fat loss and that lowering carbs and insulin doesn’t provide a magical metabolic advantage. 
 It bears repeating: if you even try to apply this study to the real world of dieting choices, you will be frowned upon strongly. Even the lead author writes:
If you need a broad and simple takeaway from this study, here is one: weight loss does not rely on certain carb levels or manipulation of insulin, it relies on eating less. Don’t be scared that eating carbs will cause insulin to trap fat inside your fat cells.",

Since a young boy, I have always struggled with being overweight and have had countless failed attempts trying to lose it. On April 3rd of last year, I decided to finally commit and really push myself to the limit and beyond both physically and mentally. I knew this time was different; my mindset and determination to succeed were stronger than ever before. Over this past year, I have learned so much, about weight loss, exercise, dieting, and myself as a person. With the use of IF/OMAD (Intermittent Fasting/One Meal A Day), keeping CICO in mind, and a consistent workout routine, I have been able to lose 180+ pounds thus far.
Height: 6’2
Age: 20 years old
Weight Difference in Before and After Picture: 438 lbs to 260 lbs (178 lbs lost)
Exercise:
I have been doing a bodybuilding routine in order to try to maintain and build as much muscle as possible while I am simultaneously losing all the weight I am. So doing a muscle building workout routine has definitely been key for me to help with my physique and not have me looking flat with all the weight I am losing.  Also, I workout (both lifting and cardio) in a fasted state, mainly to help burn fat and build muscle more efficiently.
Since I started working out in April of last year, I have tried out a variety of routines (Bro Split, 4-Day UL, 6-Day UL, 6-Day PPL, 5-Day ULPPL) and have had success with all of them but find the best and most efficient for my current schedule to be the 5-Day Upper, Lower, Push, Pull, Legs routine. I do this routine while incorporating cardio (usually HIIT) right after I am done lifting on at least 3 of those days typically. I also try to stay active on any rest days and get cardio in through sports like basketball, soccer, boxing, or going for a jog whenever I can.
Here is the current routine I am following:
Day 1 (Upper Day):
Bench Press - 4 sets - 5-8 reps
Barbell Row - 4 sets - 5-8 reps
DB Overhead Press - 3 sets - 5-8 reps
Wide-grip Pulldowns or Pull-ups - 3 sets - 6-10 reps
DB curls - 4 sets - 8-12 reps
Straight-arm Pulldowns/Face-pulls - 3 supersets - 8-12 reps
Day 2 (Lower Day):
Back Squat - 4 sets - 5-8 reps
Deadlift - 3 sets - 5-8 reps
Hack Squat - 3 sets - 5-8 reps
Lying Leg Curls - 3 sets - 8-12 reps
Single-leg Leg Press - 3 sets - 8-12 reps
Standing Calf-Raises - 4 sets - 10-15 reps
Core Workout - 4 sets - 10-15 reps
Day 3: REST / Do some form of cardio (Play sports, go for a jog, etc.)
Day 4 (Pull Day):
Barbell Row - 4 sets - 6-10 reps
Wide-grip Pulldowns or Pullups - 3 sets - 6-10 reps
T-bar, Cable or DB Rows - 3 sets - 6-10 reps
Close-grip Pulldowns - 3 sets - 8-12 reps
Straight-arm Pulldowns/Facepulls - 3 supersets - 10-15 reps each
Barbell Curls - 3 sets - 8-12 reps
Hammer Curls, Cable or DB - 3 sets - 8-12 reps
Day 5 (Push Day):
DB Bench Press - 4 sets - 6-10 reps
Overhead Press - 3 sets - 6-10 reps
Incline DB Press - 3 sets - 6-10 reps
Cable Crossovers (standing or seated) - 3 sets - 8-12 reps
Lateral Raises - 3 sets - 8-12 reps
Close-grip Bench Press - 3 sets - 8-12 reps
Tricep Extensions - 3 sets - 8-12 reps
Day 6 (Leg Day):
Back Squat - 4 sets - 6-10 reps
Deadlift - 3 sets - 6-10 reps
Leg Press - 3 sets - 6-10 reps
Leg Extensions/Leg Curls - 3 supersets - 8-12 reps
Seated Calf-Raises - 4 sets - 10-15 reps
Core Workout - 4 sets - 10-15 reps
Day 7: REST / Do some form of cardio (Play sports, Go for a jog, etc.)
Diet:
I believe that finding a long-term sustainable diet really is essential not only for losing weight, but ensuring you keep the weight off! Finding the right plan is a person to person basis so I did a lot of experimenting with different dieting techniques (IF, OMAD, Keto, Atkins etc.) until I was able to find one that I was pleased by and could see myself doing long-term. Currently, I am doing OMAD/IF on a High Protein, Low Carb diet.
Macros:
Currently I try to keep it roughly 40-45% protein, 30-35% fats, and 20% carbs. I am not very strict on these percentages but aim to keep within these ranges as much as possible.
Day of eating:
Most days I am doing OMAD (One Meal A Day) and I have this meal usually right after I workout (workout is done fasted). A regular day of eating this one meal would be a post-workout protein shake/bar, Chicken usually as my main meat source of protein, or turkey, beef etc. when I can. A salad and veggies as well as often as I can to ensure I get my greens in and a good source of fibre! Then for desert or if I need to get more fibre in I will have a fibre bar, kale chips, granola bar, or protein ice cream, which are all high sources of fibre and taste great! If I am not doing OMAD, I will be doing Intermittent Fasting on usually a 2-4 hour window to eat, where I will have the aforementioned foods except more split up. I am not really a picky eater so this is what my diet mostly consists of.
Supplements:
-Ashwaganda (Pill form, one 650mg pill before workout when I need an extra energy boost)
-Kaizen Whey Isolate Protein (2 scoops @ 35g/scoop post-workout usually)
-ENGN Shred Pre-workout (1 scoop 15-30 minutes before workout)
Conclusion:
I have really grown mentally and although my weight loss journey isn’t done yet (roughly 30-50 pounds to lose) I am proud of what I have accomplished thus far. Through this weight loss, not only have I been able to get myself to live a way healthier lifestyle and improve my mental and physical health, but I have also found a true purpose and calling for once in my life. I plan to make as big of a positive impact as possible and help/inspire as many people as I can. This is just the beginning and I’m genuinely excited for what I have planned in the future! Thanks for reading, I have love for every single one of you and wish you all the most success on your journeys! :)
EDIT: Just got back from the gym to see all the support you guys left me... and wow... I truly feel so grateful and blessed. To see all the love and support from people I don’t even know, some who are genuinely happy and proud of me... it’s something I will never take for granted. What makes me even more happy and content is how many people who are struggling with the same issues I am/was and were positively impacted by this or got that extra push they needed to keep going... to keep pushing despite all the hardships they may encounter. I just feel so blessed to have this opportunity and seriously have love for all of you. Honestly, it feels amazing to not only be recognized for all the hard work, and literal blood, sweat, and tears that led me to this point, but also be able to inspire and motivate others to work towards a better and healthier version of themselves. I promise this is only the beginning, and I will do the best I can to lead by example and make as much of a positive impact as I possibly can. And for those who were inspired/motivated by my journey and are currently facing adversity, you have to do it yourself, you must realize your potential, that potential which we all possess inside of us, and become the best version of yourself you can be. I know it’s hard and might seem impossible at times, but trust me, it is very much possible, and very much worth it. Once again, thank you all for all of the support, I genuinely appreciate all of the love. Stay blessed, and best of luck on your journeys. 🙏❤️",

Thanks to everyone for voting me
""best weight loss transformation of 2014""
. I'm back for another installment of my journey from fat to fit as requested by many of you. This is my third installment of my journey. Here is the original post from last year:
Clinically obese(class II) to ripped
My goal for this is to offer a simple blueprint that anyone can use. When I first began this journey i had no idea where to start. I'm going to highlight all my strategies that have worked in the hopes of helping someone who is in a similar predicament.
Stats
Sex: Male
Age: 27
Height: 5’10”
Before:
240lb
After:
160lb
Face gains
Recap and update
Back in 2011 I was an
obese, depressed, alcoholic, smoker.
After becoming fed up with my sloppyness and lack of dates, I started dieting and
running on a treadmill.
I lost 80lbs, quit smoking and drinking and got
really skinny.
Having lost so much weight, I had accumulated some
loose skin.
Luckily, I am privileged enough to afford the surgery to remove said skin so I took the dive and
got the surgery.
After the skin had gone I finally felt I could achieve a beach body and decided to enter a physique competition, more as a challenge to myself than anything else.
Here I am on stage in October at the Iron Man Natural.
Here is the full album from the event.
Since the competition I have transitioned into my first
intentional
bulk ever. The mental aspect of this is incredibly difficult. Keep in mind I have been dieting consistently for almost 4 years. To reverse that mentality and actually welcome weight gain has proven to be a challenge.
The beginning of the bulk was awesome. I was still lean from my competition but started filling out from the increased calories.
This gym selfie
I took got featured on a fitness motivation
Instagram account.
At the beginning of this year my local gym asked me if I would model for them as they needed pics for a new gym website. I wasn't expecting this opportunity and was not as lean as I would have liked. I agreed to the photo shoot and tried my best to dehydrate and carb load.
Here is the full album.
Diet
I've tried almost every diet and had some success with a few of them but the philosophy I choose to follow today is that of IIFYM or counting macros.
Counting macros is not a diet per se but more a way of eating that makes you aware of what you are ingesting. To count macros you use a calorie counter to track all the foods you eat and then look at the macro nutrient breakdowns of those foods and eat in an intentional way that will hit your goal number of carbs, fats and proteins. In this way you can still subscribe to a more food specific diet but doing so with this strategy makes you conscious of your macros.
For my show prep I did a classic bodybuilder prep diet consisting of tilapia, brown rice and broccoli. Although I was not IIFYM dieting, I did calculate the macros to be
45 fat, 145 carb and 225 protein(1,885 calories)
. I got incredibly lean doing this but it was unnecessarily difficult.
After the competition I began increasing my calories slowly by about 15 carbs and 3 fats a week. This is called a reverse diet and it's purpose is to allow your body to adjust to increased calories without putting on excess fat. My current lean bulking macros are
60 fat, 400 carb and 200 protein(2,940 calories)
. I've gained a total of 20lbs since beginning this increase.

Towards the end of my show prep, when I was reaching low single digit body fat percentages, my strength took a steep dive. Since my show, I have been focusing much of my time in the gym on strength.
I do Jim Wendler's Boring But Big 5/3/1 strength protocol. Here is a link to

Motivation
""How do you stay motivated?""
This is the most frequent question I've received from my reddit posts and it’s difficult to answer.
Originally my motivation was to look better and not be ignored by girls. This kept me going for a while but if that were my only motivation I would have fallen off a long time ago. Today my motivation is intrinsic, it comes from within. Lifting weights is part of who I am. It’s not something I try to get out of the way any more. I cherish my time in the gym.
In the early days, to get through times of low motivation, I made the gym part of my routine. If I didn't think about it, I wouldn't think my way out of it. After work everyday I went to the gym on my way home. Instead of being home from work at 4:30, I was home at 5:30 because I went to the gym first. Making myself go was the hardest part.
Things I wish I had known
Cardio<Weights<Diet
- This is the order of importance if an aesthetically appealing physique is the goal. Diet is the most important part of gaining or losing weight. To gain or lose weight in order to achieve an aesthetic figure, weight training is paramount. Cardio is a tool to use in conjunction with diet and weights to help achieve a caloric deficit.
Tracking
- If your goal is to achieve an aesthetic physique, tracking is a must. Tracking your diet, body weight and the weights you lift gives you the ability to view progress and analyze the variables. Being able to manipulate these variables is essential to break through plateaus. MyFitnessPal is great for tracking.
A couple years ago I was sitting on my computer reading posts like this one, wondering if it was possible for me to do the same thing. It
was
possible for me and it
is
possible for you too. I am not naturally a fit person. The success I have found has come from consistent positive choices.
If you are thinking about starting your own fitness journey,
DO IT
. You'll be glad you did. The way I feel is great, the way I look is awesome but the biggest difference is the way I'm treated today. I feel a sense of respect from complete strangers and people seem to
WANT
to talk to me. I'm still getting used to it, but it's awesome.
I'll answer any questions you may have. I'm an open book. I have no secrets.

Face gains
Recap
Back in 2011 I was diagnosed as prediabetic and
clinically obese
.
I wanted to lose weight so I started lifting weights and tracking macros.
I lost 80lbs and was left with
loose skin
and got it
surgically removed
.
After the skin was gone, I decided I could finally get over my fear of taking my shirt off in public, so I entered a
bodybuilding competition
.
Update
The bulk
- After the competition, I decided I wanted to add size and get stronger, so I started eating in a way that would increase my bodyweight and in turn also increase my strength and size. This is called
bulking
.
The first bulk got out of hand
. Although my strength had incresed a lot, when I cut down I realized that
I hadn't gained much size
.
Controlled surplus
- I learned that the amount of muscle I grew during a bulk was not necessarily proportionate to the amount of weight I was gaining. Our bodies can only create a small amount of muscle at a time, so there is no benefit to being in a large surplus of calories versus a smaller surplus of calories. The only difference is the amount of fat that is stored in addition to the muscle in a larger surplus. The important thing is to be in a surplus. This means taking in more calories than you expend in order to allow your body to adapt and get bigger and stronger.
Current condition
- I have since been bulking and cutting for a couple years. I have found a groove where I relax my diet during the winter months and eat how I want while tracking my macros to make sure I am getting sufficient protein. As a naturally fat person, this results in weight gain. I then cut during the spring or summer months. Here is my most recent
winter bulk (8 months) and summer cut (10 weeks)
Diet
As a formerly obese person, I have tried or been prescribed just about every diet out there. What I have found to be most effective is the idea of energy balance. If your goal is to gain weight, you must eat more than your body requires. This is a caloric surplus. If you want to lose weight, you need to eat less than your body requires. This is a caloric deficit. If you want to maintain your bodyweight, you must eat around the amount your body expends in a day. This is called maintenance.
Maintenance
- In order to diet (gaining or losing) you must first find your maintenance calories. You can use a calorie calculator like
this one
to help estimate this number but this is only an estimate and you will need to use trial and error to find your own personal maintenance.
Tracking weight
- How I find my maintenance calorie intake is by weighing myself daily and taking my weekly averages. If my average weight from 2 consecutive weeks is around the same, I have found my maintenance calories. It is a moving target and will not be the same at the end of a cut as it was at the beginning of a cut.
Tracking calories
- Once I know my maintenance calories, I can gain weight by adding calories to that number or lose weight by subtracting. When I begin a gaining or losing phase, I always start with increments of 500 calories at a time added onto my daily calorie goals. If I was maintaining my weight on 2500 calories a day, I would begin my diet on 2,000. I subtract these calories from carbs and fats. The tricky part is tracking accurately. I use
MyFitnessPal
.
Macros -
In a caloric surplus, as long as I am getting enough protein (0.8 to 1 gram per lb of bodyweight), it does not matter where the rest of the calories come from. In a deficit on the other hand, it can be important. If I am dieting, I always make sure to have at least 50 to 60 grams of fat. I have gone below 50 and I felt horrible. I keep my protein static year round and I eat as many carbs as my goals will allow. I like food.
bulking macros
: 450 carb/190 protein/75 fat
cutting macros
: 250 carb/190 protein/60 fat
Supplements:
creatine, fish oil, multivitamin, whey. I have never used steroids.
Training
Strength training
To increase size and strength it is necessary to practice progressive overload. This is the idea of handling a higher workload overtime. The easiest way to do this is by focusing on strength. For this reason, I suggest starting out with a strength routine. I have done a couple strength routines in the past including
5/3/1
and
Starting Strength
. These are great routines.
Bodybuilding
- Over my lifting career, I have gravitated towards bodybuilder style lifting. I lift relatively heavy weights with an emphasis on stretching the muscle at one end of the rep and squeezing the muscle at the other end. I find that I feel good doing this and do not get injured. Most importantly, I enjoy it. By doing this day in and day out, I do gain strength (progressive overload) although not nearly as quickly as I would with a strength routine.
Current maxes:
OHP: 185lb 1RM
Squat: 365lb 3RM
Bench: 275lb 3RM
DL: 405lb (last tested over a year ago)
But how??
""How do I motivate myself?""
This is the most frequent question I've received from my reddit posts and it’s difficult to answer. I don't know what motivates anyone else. For me, I got sick and tired of being sick and tired. I read every transformation post on
r/fitness
over and over again until I had an idea of what to do and I finally took action. After that, I fell in love with this lifestyle. I no longer need to stay motivated because this is just what I like to do.
Make it routine
- When I was obese, I worked 40 hours a week and was very tired when I got home. The last thing I wanted to do was drive another 20 minutes to the gym. What I did instead was brought my gym clothes with me to work. I changed in the bathroom at work and stopped at the gym on my way home. This way it wasn't a choice. I did not need strong willpower every day. It was just part of my routine. The hardest part is often just getting to the gym.
Lessons learned
Cardio is not necessary for weightloss
- In the begining of my journey,
I ran on an elliptical every day and I hated it
. What I didn't know at the time was the idea of energy balance. Cardio worked because it increased my daily energy expenditure and forced me into a deficit. What I wish I had known was that those 300 calories I was burning every day on the elliptical could have just as easily come out of my diet. One less pop tart would have had the exact same affect on my physique.
Tracking accurately
- Diet is the most important aspect of fitness. The way we look, feel and perform comes down to diet above all else. In order to control this aspect, it is important to be able to track it accurately. For me, this took a lot of practice. A behavior of mine that contributed to my obesity and still hinders my diet sometimes is unconscious eating. I stand in front of the fridge or a cupboard and shovel food into my mouth without even recognizing it. By tracking everything that enters my mouth I am able to recognize unconscious eating and stop myself before I start. Tracking my diet, body weight, pictures and the weights I lift also gives me the ability to view progress and analyze variables. Being able to manipulate these variables is essential to achieving my goals.
If you are thinking about getting started on your own fitness journey, do yourself a favor and begin today. My only regret is not starting sooner. I have found a new way of life in fitness and it has allowed me to achieve things I didn't think were possible for me. Thanks again for all the support. I am truly grateful for this subreddit.
Ask any questions you may have. I will do my best to answer every last one.

For my diet plan I consumed at least 2k calories a day or more and my diet isn't really that fancy, I stay away from fried foods, noodles, rice, and really fattening foods on the week days and i definitely stay away from junk food/fast foods and soda and I usually eat grilled meats like chicken beef, etc I also eat salads, grilled vegetables and sometimes fish and I have little cheat days on the weekends where I eat meals that includes grilled meats on top of rice and Sundays are my full cheat days where I'll eat whatever I want and not go to hard of course!
This has really been a spiritual journey for me, because I have been over weight my whole entire life. I got laughed at, made fun of, and got joked about and it never felt good, then years passed by when i got my first job and they hosted a weight loss competition and I was like you know what lets try it and finally had the courage to sign up for a gym membership. At first it was going good and lost 60 lbs and felt impressed with my self, the results came in and i lost and felt devastated and lost motivation. My friends still encourage me and said ""you know even though you lost you still lost 60 lbs which is incredible you should still keep trying!"" and I was like ""you know what? you guys are right!"" So I tried going back, but it felt different, I didn't feel the same motivation as I did before and I didn't last long and kept on failing over and over and started to slowly gain my weight back and was depressed and went MIA. because I felt so ashamed. Years passed by and I moved to Saint Louis to work at my cousins restaurant to start my life anew, to find myself and then one night...I skyped with one of my best friends and when I saw him I was so shocked, because he been trying to get fit too and he looked amazing, he progressed so much and I was like wow....and we talked and he gave me good advice encouraging me and etc. All night I was thinking ""wow....I'm really jealous, think i could've looked like that? what if I never gave up, what if I actually stayed on tracked..I don't think I can do it.."" but the next morning something happened..I felt something different inside me and I was like you know what....I don't wanna feel this way anymore! No more What ifs! I'm going to get my ass up and go back to the gym! The first week there....I finally felt it...the motivation that I had before except this time it was stronger, this time I'm not going to give up, I won't fail this time, I'm going to turn those dreams into reality and I felt an endless amount of motivation flowing inside of me and was able to push my self beyond my limits and even surpassed my weight goal of 200 and got to 190 and i feel great!
I made a facebook video telling my whole story here, because I want to encourage people to never give up and achieve their goals!

No matter how many times you fall, always find the courage to stand back up again and keep pushing forward! I know I still got ways to go, but I promise I won't stop here and will keep on going strong because I do have some loose skin that I need to convert to muscle now and I won't give up!
Never Give up, Believe in yourself!

Edit: The post was removed due to some
self-promotion rules.
SO I must adhere to them by probably summarizing the content of a 9000 word article. Okay so here goes:
What is the ketogenic (keto) diet?
The ketogenic diet is not intended to be a temporary diet for weight loss, although it works great for that, but it is more of a lifestyle change where you consistently and drastically reduce the amount of carbs you ingest. It not only makes you burn fat for energy (more on that below) but helps you become very aware of how rampant and ubiquitous carbs are in this day and age.
Why is it called ketogenic?
The word ketogenic is made up of two words: keto- and -genic.
The prefix “keto-” is short for ketones.
The suffix “-genic” is the same as genesis, which refers to “the creation of something”
So the word ketogenic literally means the “creation of ketones.”
Ketones are created from the break down of fat for energy when the body doesn’t get enough carbs.
When the body is creating ketones, it is said to be in a state of ketosis where fat becomes the main source of fuel for energy rather than sugar (glycolysis).
What the fuck are ketones?
Ketones are like water-soluble fat molecules that can cross the blood-brain-barrier and provide energy for the brain.  There is this myth where people say that you MUST eat carbs because the brain can only survive off carbs or glucose. What they don’t know (or conveniently forget to mention) is that the brain operates perfectly on ketones as well.  Think of them as the 4th macronutrient after carbs, protein and fat.
How is ketosis achieved?
Ketosis is achieved by practicing strict carbohydrate restriction consistently. The general limit is about 25-50grams of net carbs a day which is far lower than the typical 200-300grams most people ingest per day.  (Net carbs are carbs minus fiber.) Those carbs must be replaced with healthy fat sources. It takes a few days for ketosis to actually occur because you have a glycogen supply to get through initially, but one can reach ketosis faster if they exercise.
Note: One can also reach ketosis if they starve themselves completely of all foods, but that is not ideal or recommended. What we're after is not starvational ketosis but nutritional ketosis which is achieved in the same fashion by simply restricting carbs.
What are the benefits of being in ketosis?
The promises of a ketogenic diet are quite impressive:
Helpful for metabolic syndrome (obesity) and preventing diabetes
Increased meal satiety and appetite blunting. This diet is more satiating than a low-fat diet and tends to makes it easier to avoid caloric overconsumption.
Greater rate of fat loss due to state of ketosis rather than glycolysis.
Note: You literally become a fat-burning machine.
Reduction or complete elimination of Type-2 Diabetes (Reduction in insulin resistance)
Reduction or complete elimination of hypertension (high blood pressure).
Improved lipid fat profile: LDL (the bad cholesterol) particle size increases which is a good thing. (The smaller ones cause more damage.)
The SIZE of LDL particles may be more important than concentration of LDL cholesterol.
Recent studies have shown independent relationships of levels of LDL size to risk of heart disease.
Prevention of various cancers and reduction of cancer growths.
The mitochondria of cancer cells are damaged and require 200x the normal amounts of glucose to replicate at rapid rates. They cannot utilize ketones and cannot survive in ketosis without the presence of excess glucose.
Possible treatment for Alzheimers.
(
another study)
Possible treatment for Parkinsons
Improved memory for older adults
Reduction or complete elimination of chronic systemic inflammation.
A ketogenic diet has profoundly anti-inflammatory effects.
Improved cardiovascular health
Very high muscle-sparing effect. (Muscle loss is mitigated in ketosis even at a caloric deficit!)
Proven treatment for epilepsy, more effective than current medications without the side effects.
You can extrapolate that if it’s helping reverse the diseased conditions of people with Type 2 diabetes, cancer, heart disease, epilepsy, Alzheimer’s and so forth, that it may PROACTIVELY help those of us who are not afflicted by those conditions and want to avoid them!
Before I continue: The ketogenic diet is NOT a panacea
The truth is that there is not a single, perfect diet that works for everybody.  In regards to this diet specifically,
Dom D’agostino
says that this diet is excellent for ~70% of people out there but ~30% of the population does not respond well to this diet. Btw, Dom D’agostino is the expert that originally got me hooked to trying keto. He calls ketones the 4th macronutrient in
this podcast with Tim Ferris.
Weight loss is NOT guaranteed on keto. You still need to be wary of your total intake of calories and counting your calories/macros is recommended until you figure out the diet. But after a lot of experience, many people find the keto diet to be liberating because they are able to maintain the diet without the need for calorie counting by consistently choosing only keto-friendly foods.
Why do you have to restrict the carbs so sharply? How does the body transition to burning fats for energy?
I wrote a ton on that topic and I'm just summarizing here so here's a tl;dr infographic:
http://i.imgur.com/HeEYexT.png
So… What are carbohydrates?
Carbs are sugar. Sugars are carbs.  There are simple carbs (monosaccharides) and complex carbs (polysaccharides). There are also sugars found naturally in foods and extra sugars added artificially to foods. In the context of a ketogenic diet, they’re all pretty much the same because the body eventually breaks them down into their simplest forms regardless. (The carbs that you will eat will come almost entirely from veggies or nuts on this diet.)
Don't we need carbs for energy?
Despite your body needing to break down carbs first and foremost when they are ingested, carbs are NOT an essential nutrient.  An essential nutrient is one your body needs to survive because it won’t be able to make it on its own.  But your body readily creates sugar from fat and protein to regulate blood sugar levels.
Many people think they need carbs to perform at their very best performance-wise, but that’s not true either. It takes a few weeks, but after someone becomes completely adapted to the ketogenic diet, they become very, very efficient at burning fats for fuel and the bandwidth or throughput within which your body can do this at is great. It’s been ingrained in us that we need carbs to survive, or perform at our peak as athletes. We see sugar as energy. We see athletes drink Gatorade, so we think we can’t perform at our best without it. We almost rely on it as a crutch. But when you’re keto-adapted you are not chained to the hypoglycemic rollercoaster.
I'm only a quarter way through the article and it's only summarized the key points but the rest of the article talks about
What's wrong with carbs

And please remember that diets are an extremely complex subject. There is no perfect diet and it's not all about just doing something for weight loss. Diet is influenced by culture, religion, social influence, family, ethics... for some it's as simply as drinking soylent and nothing more. For some, they view it through a lens of biochemistry and physiology and geek out over metabolically hacking their body. It's all about finding out what works for you. On the keto diet, I was able to sleep well and have good recovery between strength/skill training sessions and felt a constant state of mental focus (I still do, I've been keto for like 3 months straight now with 5 months total experience), so it's nice to be able to share what it's all about, in case it jives with anyone.",

Instead of simply playing the game, I also played a meta-game of spreadsheets, equations, simulators, math, numbers, and I was able to achieve character power and success I never had before.

It's been a long time since my WoW min/maxing obsession days but I still remember how to think that way. And it's because I do that when I read questions like this:
What's better for functional strength - powerlifting, bodybuilding, or strongman?
Should I do 5/3/1 or GZCL?
How can I optimize my PPL routine?
When do you become an intermediate?
All I see is this:
Should I play a Warlock or a Mage or a Shadow Priest?
Should I be Arms or Fury?
What's the Best in Slot gear at Tier 9 for my Ret Paladin? (fuckin' rerolling, that's what)
Is my gearscore high enough to do Heroic ICC?
To put it in the vernacular: Hi, my name is John, and I hate every single one of you.
If you're not familiar with the term ""min/maxing"", it's shorthand for ""minimizing weaknesses / maximizing strengths"". The concept is to build the most powerful possible character with what you've got, often also determining the best things to get. In practice, what this boils down to is little more than doing a bunch of math, which works out pretty well because that's what many games, especially RPGs, are based on. And for the most part this strategy is incredibly successful, across many different games. There are parts of it that can even be applied to aspects of real life with success. So people get into a habit of thinking this way. And then they get into lifting, and try to think the same way.
But there's a problem - Lifting is not a fucking video game. And you people need to stop, because you are driving the rest of us insane.
Min/Maxing is touted as being a strategy for making strong characters. But in my opinion, what it's really about is removing as much effort from gameplay as possible. This does not just apply to the dudes who make twinks (not that kind) to steamroll the game. Even for people who try to build the most powerful characters so that they can tackle the hardest possible content are still, ultimately, trying to reduce their effort level. Fundamentally, min/maxing is about trying to front-load effort through thinking, doing math, planning, and acquiring the right gear, to reduce the impact that their gameplay can have on their success. It is about determining the perfect way to create a character that can be as successful as possible, as quickly as possible, just by virtue of knowing all the pieces, where they come from, and exactly how you will acquire them and in what order, in advance, before you even truly do anything in the game itself.
Does
this
sound
familiar
to
anyone?
This is reason number one that lifting cannot be treated like a video game. The 80/20 rule is out in force, and for my money one of the top three of what gets you the 80% (it's really more like 90, IMO), alongside consistency and time, is effort. Min/maxing is about transmuting future effort in execution into present effort in planning, so that by the latter you have reduced how much is required in the former. But this is backwards and wrong. Success in lifting is heavily tied to effort in execution, and only tenuously at best to effort in planning. Focusing on having a ""perfect"" training and diet plan while leaving the execution of that plan as a given is flawed at best and self-sabotage at worst. I've said this so many different ways that I feel like a broken record, but I truly believe it needs to be hammered on again and again - effort trumps intelligence. The time to focus on your effort and execution is not after you have created a great plan and it fails, as you would when min/maxing, it is from Day 1.
It sounds stupid to have to say that video games are nothing like real life, but apparently on some level people don't understand this, and it is reason number two to please for everyone's sanity stop treating lifting like an MMO. The entire practice of min/maxing hinges completely and 100% on all inner workings of the game being both completely knowable and infinitely replicable. If DickSocks69 puts the same gear on his character as WarlockMasterXXX, the math and equations that determine their characters' potential damage will always be exactly the same. And both of them can always know exactly what those equations are, how any of the potential random factors average out on a certain timescale, and even what the most optimal rotation or priority list of spellcasting is. But human beings are not RPG characters that are built on math equations. You cannot take Jim and Bill and put them on identical training and dietary plans and have their results be exactly the same. Ever. There is simply too much variance at every possible level and too many factors that are unknowable. This should be obvious, but every single day people behave as though they don't understand that they are not an Orc Warlock.
Finally, there is an inherent attitude of min/maxing that is incompatible with the pursuit of lifting. As always, the context of this is having actual goals. The attitude I mean has many facets and can be described in a many ways, but one I feel that captures a lot of them is ""When can I stop?"" Part of the strategy of min/maxing is about minimizing the grind from character creation to the highest levels, and acquiring the best gear as rapidly as possible, because it is not until this point that ""the real game actually starts"". Min/maxing treats the process of a character growing as a waste of your time, a barrier that must be torn down. If you think of leveling up or iteratively improving the power of your gear as a parallel for training, it becomes about trying to skip as much training as possible.
But this, again, is completely backwards, and ties back in to the first point about effort avoidance. Skipping training is wrong - You want to train more, not less. In a game, you can come up with character builds that manipulate numbers and allow you to walk into a level, lay waste to it, and rapidly advance through the game. But there is no such thing as a secret training and diet plan that is so well planned out, so firmly based in science, that it removes so much effort while giving you such rapid results - because effort and time are primary drivers in results. You can't, through the magic of perfect exercise and food selection, skip the years of consistency and effort it takes most people to achieve their true goals, in the way you can blast from Level 1 to 90 by dumping a bunch of +Experience Gain gear onto your character.
I see this way of thinking fuck with people constantly. Everyone I've ever tried to help with any fitness goal who was a nerd first, they have this exact same problem. And I say all this because I have been there too, and for me, it was only because I figured out how to break myself that I ever got down to the brass tacks of actually busting my balls in training and accomplished anything real. The challenge is not simply to understand that this way of thinking is not compatible with every pursuit, and why, but it is more importantly about learning how to find the switch in your head so you can turn it off sometimes. I don't have any advice to offer there other than to say that I know there's a switch because I found it. But I've only got a map for my own head.""

:
Height:
5'9''
Body fat:
9.2%
220 / 157
Face progress
Full two years
Full Yeard, since people keep mentioning it
For the first eighteen months of this, I was kind of winging it at the gym and just trying to eat right to the best of my ability. I plateaued at ~175 lbs and couldn't seem to make much more progress. It was then that I began seriously reading these forums and discovered all types of things involving nutrition and fitness; most importantly, counting calories. I decided I wanted my abs to be visible. I learned that for this to be possible, a body fat of ~10% or less was required. So in June, I downloaded MyFitnessPal and began counting my calories. It was also then that I adopted a vegan ""diet"", at first for nutritional benefits, and now for all sorts of reasons.
My average caloric intake over this period ranged from 1,500 to 2,300 per day; I was experimenting for the first three months or so. Now it seems as though 1,800 - 2,000 allows me to lose the amount of fat that I'm comfortable with. Here are my most current dietary goals:
DIET
CALORIES PER DAY:
1,800*
Protein: ~110g
Carbs: ~300g
Fat: ~70g
Calories per day was my goal with cardio included. I am realizing the macros don't add up.
FREQUENT FOODS
Breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks weren't planned whatsoever. I would pretty much just eat throughout the day whenever I was hungry. The key was sticking to reasonably low calorie foods and keeping the cheat meals at a minimum:
Cereal
Bananas
Baked beans
Boca burgers
Gardein products
Tofurkey products
NuGo protein bars
White or brown rice
Lightlife smart dogs
Steam-in-bag vegetables
Soy, almond, coconut, and flax milk
CHEATING:
Whiskey
Craft beer
Taco Bell (I know)
Diet soda (not really a cheat, but kept my sanity)
SUPPLEMENTS:
Creatine
Beta Alanine
Various types of soy, rice, pea, and hemp protein powders
EXERCISE
I've been doing PPL (Push/Pull/Legs) for the last seven weeks, with this last one consisting of a deloading phase. Here are my daily routines for the first six weeks:
MONDAY:
PUSH (chest / shoulders / triceps)
Bench: 195 lbs (5x5)
Shoulder Press: 90 lbs (5x5)
Tricep Pulldown: 60 lbs (5x5)
1-3 mile run
Abs (ab roller, planks)
TUESDAY:
CARDIO
3-6 mile run
WEDNESDAY:
PULL (back / biceps)
Deadlift: 175 lbs (5x5)
Chin Ups: Body weight (5x5)
Cable Row: 100 lbs (5x5)
Dumbbell Alternate Curls: 40 lbs (5x5)

REFLECTIONS, LESSONS LEARNED, & ADVICE
To be brief, there are two very specific things that influenced my change and neither of them involve fitness. If you care to know, they are the films of
Terrence Malick
and the music of
Tool
, specifically ""
Lateralus
"".
I mention those unrelated influences to highlight the fact that a desire for a ""nice body"" isn't necessarily a prerequisite to significant physical, mental, or emotional health. I wanted my
life
to improve. Those two things were my conduit, but I soon did realize that my health would eventually need to improve at least
somewhat
for me to be comfortable. Hell, my original goal weight was 185! When I reached that, I kept going. I felt a hunger and addiction because the results were tangible and I could feel myself changing in every single way, all for the better.
In reading these forums, the one thing I've taken away is this:
Do not believe everything you read here or anywhere else
. There are absolutely wonderful things here, especially in the FAQ, and certainly from various posts I've read over the last six months; but do not believe or adhere to any one thing.
Experiment
with your own body. Do not be discouraged if something is working wonderfully for someone but doesn't seem right for you. It's incredibly discouraging to strive so hard at something and fail miserably. I will tell you that I've tried countless different exercises and routines (both dietary and physical) and am just now starting to figure my body out.
A long time ago I read someone say, ""Anyone who has exercised for less than five years is a beginner."", and I called complete bullshit on that statement. Now, though, two years into this myself, I am starting to see his point. Your body is so complex that it's utterly mind-boggling. So many people want such a quick fix. It simply doesn't work that way. It takes effort. It takes time. It takes dedication. If you allow these three things to work in conjunction with one another, you
will
see and feel results.
MOVING FORWARD
This week I have started a 'clean, slow' bulk. That is to say, I'm eating 250 cals above maintenance, upping my protein, and following P.H.U.L. (Power-Hypertrophy-Upper-Lower). My plan is to do this for three months, cut back down for three more, and see what I've managed to accomplish. I have never been more excited about any aspect of my life than I am for these next six months. Although it was not the original spark, fitness has absolutely changed my life. Thanks for reading.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS & COMMENTS:
""Do you have trouble getting protein being a vegan?""
No.
""Juice!""
No.
""Your lifts look like shit and -insert broism here-""
My lifts were for maintenance purposes only and were set at very moderate weights accordingly. Most of my focus was on diet and cardio.
""Did you drink alcohol?""
Yes, but put limits on myself. One craft beer per night, tops, with one or two small glasses of whiskey, tops. I plan on cutting it down to the weekends during this bulk.
""Do you have loose skin?""
Yes, but pretty minimal. It is visible when I sit down.
""How much could you run when you first started out?""
For the first month or so I was unable to even run for 10 straight minutes. Consistency is key. I can do a 10k without being remotely winded, now.
""Should I do cardio before or after weights?""
In my experience, absolutely after weights. This does not apply to leg day, though. Don't do that.",

Background
I’ve been going to the gym regularly for most of my adult life but it wasn’t until March 2019 that I decided to seriously take a look and dedicate time to understanding my body and seek assistance for diet, macro counting, and splits.
I thought I could do this work on my own but when my macro counting has been terrible. I didn’t know how to do this, it was overwhelming, and quite honestly not very intuitive to macro count. I was putting waaaay too much into my body, and when the scale kept going up, I truly wondered why my body wasn't changing the way I wanted (frankly, NEEDED) it to do.
My lifestyle was fairly sedentary, I’d go hiking occasionally but outside of the gym 5 times a week, I didn’t do much but sit even when I got home.
From 03/02/2019 - 07/15/2019 my days have been twice a day at the gym, early morning target cardio (plan below and what that means) and then heavy lifting in the afternoon. Depending on how I feel, this is usually six days a week.
Current Lifestyle
I’m a software consultant, sitting behind a desk 5 days a week. My life, outside of working out two times a day, six days a week, is pretty sedentary, even today, so I have to be hyper aware of my nutrition and ensure that my food intake is as clean as possible.
Actual Workout
(03/02/2019 - 07/01/2019)
At the beginning from March through June, I was hitting every major muscle group around once a week. My splits would look something like:
Day 1: Legs
Day 2: Delts + Target Cardio
Day 3: Back
Day 4: Chest + Target Cardio
Day 5: Arms
Day 6: Delts - because they’re STUBBORN + Target Cardio
Day 7: High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) Cardio
07/02/2019 - Present
Tracking the photos, I knew what areas were weakest. My trainer put a plan in place to help adjust to focus more on my weaker areas so my splits changed. Also note: I added targeted cardio daily to the workout routine to help cut more. Cardio consists of
at least
45-mins targeting heart rate at 115 - 135 bpm, my body's fat burn zone. Side note: targeted cardio can be done walking on a treadmill, it's boring, so find some music, tv, anything to get through it.
The other thing is what works for me, may not work for you. Know your body, its limits, and what you can accomplish and what areas you need to focus on. My trainer has been a huge asset in helping me understanding my own body and what areas I need to work on.
Day 1: Legs + Mid-back; Target cardio
Day 2: Chest; Target cardio
Day 3: Back/biceps (lat dominant); Target cardio
Day 4: Delts/core; Target cardio
Day 5: Legs/triceps; Target cardio
Day 6: Chest/light delts; Target cardio
Day 7: High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) Cardio; abs
My delts and lats continue to be pretty stubborn and I'm slowly realizing I'll always have to go after them in the gym multiple times a week.
Overall diet
I am a creature of habit, my diet is pretty boring, especially when I find something good I usually keep it in my week. For that reason, I’m just going to show my macro counts because I’m not eating anything special.
I adjust my macro intake based on what muscle group I’m working on. Larger muscle groups will have higher carbs and protein; smaller groups will be higher fats and protein, low carbs.
Back and Legs (Large muscle group)
-  I try to consume around 1734 Kcal, which will consist of 46% Carbs; 46% proteins; 24% fats.
Arms/rest day (smaller muscle group) -
Calories: 1562 Kcal, which consists of 26% carbs; 32% proteins; 42% fats
Chest/delts (smaller muscle group) -
Calories: 1728 Kcal, which consists of 27% carbs; 30% proteins 43% fats.
GET A FOOD SCALE. GAME. CHANGER.
Meal prep in general is a struggle for me, it takes me about two hours overall on a Sunday. I know, not that much,  but my god, time is so limited, that’s the last thing I want to do. So crafting recipes that I can throw in a slow cooker, rice maker, insta pot has been a life saver.
Supplements
: I take
L-Carnitine
for fasted cardio;
L-Arginine
(3g) pre-workout;
BCAA
(5g) 3:1:1 ratio during the workout; G
lutamine
(5g) post workout;
Glucosamine
before bed.
Super greens powder
for when I didn’t feel like I didn’t eat enough vegetables that day.
My Thoughts / Takeaways
So I’m a little more than four months in and I’m scared. I don’t want to go back to that person I was in March. It’s such a short amount of time I’m scared that I could go back to that person any minute. I know I won’t be able to maintain these incredible results long term - it’s going to get harder and come more slowly, so I know I have to readjust my expectations. Seeing the current results and progress is so addicting. I love seeing my body transform. It’s like a science experiment where I get to experience the results first hand.
I feel incredible - I have more energy, more stamina, I fall asleep in 5-mins when I go to bed. I was always hitting high blood pressure for my age and I check my blood pressure periodically and my blood pressure is all in the normal ranges now.
The biggest challenge of this process is knowing and being honest with myself. Six days a week, twice a day, is very hard. I may feel like shit after a day at work and I have to know my body - am I fighting exhaustion or am I just in a bad mood? If it’s exhaustion, it’s fine, I can take a day to break or I can go after a nap and it’s going to be alright.
Another challenge behind this is the social aspect. People are mean when it comes to this journey! Socializing, going to dinner and drinks after work, I will find anything on the menu to fit my dietary needs for the day. I don’t want to put anyone out, but I often find people don’t like it when I say I’m going to eat a salad, or I won’t drink alcohol at a happy hour. I can brush it off for now. If you have thoughts behind this, please let me know! I’m still learning and would love to know your thoughts.",

Here’s my lessons learned so far.","At the end of last year, I read a book titled Living with a Seal, where the author had a Navy Seal move him with him and his family for 31 days. His reason for doing this:
I felt like I was drifting on autopilot in my life. Wake up, go to work, go to the gym — repeat. I wanted to shake things up. I wanted to get better.
That really resonated with me. I’m sure a ton of other people in here feel the same exact way. We get stuck in the same routines in life, and in the gym. So I knew that I wanted to find a fitness challenge this year.
At the same time, I remember reading about The Rock’s workout and nutrition program in Muscle & Fitness last spring. I was fascinated that he was able to do that. We all sort of write it off like “oh, but he has trainers and a private chef or takes illegal substances” but at the end of the day, that’s a ton of commitment and dedication. And he has done is while his career absolutely exploded over the last few years.
I decided to see if I could do the same thing, see how I measure up. This isn’t about following a fitness and eating plan that’s optimized for me. It seemed like too much food for a guy my size. It’s also not about using this plan for specific results. I have no desire to look like The Rock. It was just about “can I do this really hard thing this successful guy does while living a normal life?”

Things I’ve Learned
The hardest part actually is the food prep: having to make 7 meals a day, every day, for month is hard to do with a full-time job and a family to take care of. if anyone is interested, I can share more details about this.
Though I’m 6’3”/207lbs and The Rock is 6’5”/260lbs, I haven’t gained any weight eating 5,000 calories a day. I would have thought at this surplus it would have led to putting on some weight. But I’m noticeably building muscle while getting leaner.
Podcasts and Audiobooks! This is how I spend 2+ hours in the gym 6 days a week. Music just doesn’t hold my focus for that amount of time. I also feel like I’m getting smarter and bettering myself in the process.
I feel great. I’m 37, around the time when mysterious aches and pains pop up. Eating like this is preventing any muscle soreness or DOMS. And I’m lifting heavier than I had in awhile. Makes me realize I definitely haven’t been eating enough, and that sometimes your body needs high glycemic carbs (something I’ve avoided for years).
Eating like The Rock isn’t cheap. It’s costing me about $42/day, putting this whole experiment at a monthly budget of almost $1300. It’s mostly the cod that gets you, that alone is $18/day.
This experience has been eye-opening for me, especially how the nutrition is affecting my workout. Kind of blew apart some cutting/bulking views I had. Thought /Fitness would benefit from what I'm learning. Questions or comments? Fire away.

I made a video that teaches you how to perform the Perfect Lunge to Stretch them so you could get more hip extension!","In this follow-along video,
I share with you the intricacies that turn the lunge into a
very effective
stretch for your hip flexors which are the muscles at the front of the thigh/hips. The muscles such as the
rectus femoris
and the
iliopsoas complex.
)
Benefits:
For people who sit a lot and don't stretch the hip flexors, they have often lost all hip extension and need to restore it. Stretching the hip flexors will help your hips
have more hip extension
(read: the ability to bring your thighs behind you without arching the lower back to compensate).
Lunges are a commonly prescribed basic stretch if someone is having lower back pain, because the iliopsoas complex (deep hip flexor) connects the thighs to the lower back, and if they're tight they pull on the lower back. Doing it in a low lunge is a very good start toward stretching them.
The cues in the video (squaring, tucking, etc) are applicable to
ALL
hip flexor stretches, including high/standing lunges or the couch/wall quad stretch and so forth.

I teach you how to square the hips (remember, it's always back-hip forward, front-hip backward), then my favorite way of getting people to tuck the hips (posteriorly tilt the hips using your hands) and small but important details like making sure the back foot is in line with the mat/carpet and the front foot is ahead of the knee and so on.

This year I am sharing swimming secrets of long time swimmers like myself that you never see written elsewhere and no-one explains","Hi all,
I am mod of
/r/swimming
and an experienced marathon swimmer (over thirty open water swims greater than 10k). 
I usually post some advice here each New Year to assist new and improvng swimmers, and people hoping to use swimming for exercise and weight management.
Swimming is a sport that when done consistently will allow you to pursue it for an entire lifetime and reward you for doing do.
/r/swimming
is a great resource, especially if you use the search bar, as there is almost no question that hasn't been asked and gotten an answer previously.
Here's last year advice
.
I've said previously that there are no tricks or secrets in learning to swim. But it’s not entirely accurate about other aspects of swimming. 
These are secrets in that experienced swimmers know them, but it can take a long time for others to learn. These are the nuggets of knowledge that get passed in changing rooms and on decks, and are part of what we might call swim culture.
This should help collect some of the “soft” knowledge that experienced swimmers gain over time and so many new and improving swimmers haven’t yet learned, especially if they are not part of a swim group.
Lane Etiquette
By far the most annoying thing for swimmers are people joining the lane who have no understanding of lane etiquette used around the world by experienced swimmers. Actually this often includes the lifeguards on duty many of whom (most in my experience)  don’t understand either.
Below are four simple rules. Yes, I know as a beginner you think this is too much, but people don’t play golf with a hockey stick, so I don’t know why non-swimmers think swimming is different.
Here is a comprehensive explanation of lane swimming etiquette  if you are inclined
.
* Ask or let the swimmer already in the lane know you are joining.
* Don’t start swimming or turn in front of a faster swimmer.
* The fastest swimmer has the right of way.
* Stay aware of what everyone is doing to avoid collisions and frustration for all.
Goggles
Because every swimmer in the world has an opinion and will happily entertain long discussions about goggs.
No anti-fog will last on goggles longer than a couple of months
Spit into googles for a simple reasonably effective anti-fog. Never touch the inside of the goggles.
Use a 2/3 water, 1/3 baby shampoo mix, swirl it around and rinse it out for a more effective anti-fog
Most “high visibility open water goggles” aren’t high visibility and are seriously over-priced. The google design offering the most visibility are clear Swedish goggles (aka Swedes). Which are also the cheapest.
More expensive goggles does not in any way mean better. Blame triathletes for the escalation of costs. The best goggles I’ve bought in years were €4 in Lidl the summer before last.
There is no such thing as a generic “best google” answer. Competitive swimmers/online swimmers most often respond Vanquishers  or Swedish Goggles. Vanquishers are not available in Europe anymore & Swedes (Which I wear myself in the pool and
I show you how to fit here
) aren’t a good idea for beginner swimmers. I also wrote
this article about understanding the different kinds of goggles
so you can choose based on your own requirements rather than other’s opinions, because I had never once seen anything like this by any of the goggle manufacturers, or anyone else.
Silicon straps don’t last long. Bungee straps are a great replacement.
Two thirds of my swimming time is spent with my face underwater exhaling. I can see everything including guys jerking off, teenagers and older couples fiddling with each other and numerous erections.
Technique (Front crawl)
The name of the stroke is front crawl. Freestyle means that in competition you can swim any stroke, and since crawl is the fastest, it (mostly) gets used, so a lot of swimmers think crawl is freestyle and visa versa. Someone will probably even say in the comments here that no-one calls it front crawl. Front crawl is extensively used outside the US and is the accurate term.
BLABT  is the acronym for the process most swim experienced teachers use to evaluate stroke and teach front crawl. It stands for:
B
ody position
Get horizontal in the water. Not being horizontal is the most common reason for swimming slow.
Push your chest forward and down into the water. Try to swim downhill!
Keep your head low and steady, don’t allow it to swing to the side. Imagine you are an a rotisserie spit that enters through your forehead, your whole body rotates around the centre point. If you raise your head, it’ll cause the rest of your body to sink.
Clench your butt cheeks. (Core muscles are used for position and rotation, doing this helps engage them).
L
egs
In an elite swimmer, the maximum propulsion that comes from kicking is only 15% of overall speed. But to do that requires the body’s largest muscles and disproportionate amount of energy. (Long distance swimmers like myself do very little or no kicking).
Fixing the kick is important for beginners so the legs don’t slow you down or cause you to sink. Kicking wildly (especially common in runners or triathletes) is more likely to cause you to slow. This is also part of the horizontal body position above. From what I have seen most triathlete swim coaches get this completely wrong and spend far too much time focusing on a better kick.
You are not riding a bicycle. Kick from the hips, with only a little movement in the knees. New swimmers often have a big wide kick or their legs sinks, or both. This slows them down.
While reading this, see if you can point your toes like a ballet dancer. If you can’t, start stretching your ankle while watching TV or while sitting at a desk. Not being able to point your toes while swimming is like pulling a weight behind you.
Try swimming with your toes clenched into a fist.
Yes, just like Die Hard
. This will stop you kicking from the knees. You won’t be able to do it all the time, but it will help you understand what your position and kick should feel like.
A
rms
Reach forward. Further still.
Pull back underwater. But only when your palm is facing backwards behind you, not when they are facing the bottom. This called the Catch, when your hand starts effectively pulling.
Keep pulling, then pushing backwards until your thumb scrapes your thigh.
Try to always keep your elbow above your hand, at every point in the stroke. * This is not easy, and take a long time to get right.
B
reathing
Exhale underwater
Hum a little to get used to controlling your breath and exhalation
Try sinking to the bottom of the pool with no arm or leg movement. This will help you learn breath control. Only do this when there is a lifeguard present.
Rotate your head out of the water, don’t lift it. Don’t look forward or around. There is no forward visibility as part of standard front crawl, and learning this is a separate activity.
T
iming
Both arms and legs alternate and all actions are smooth and continuous.
Breathing is to the side.
Rotate your hips to drive your arms to reach forward.
Swimwear
Buy your swim suits one size smaller than the size you think you should wear based on your street clothes because water causes fabric to expand. You can’t see it but others can.
Wear your swimsuit in the shower after your pool swim, it’s easiest way to wash out the chlorinated water. Suits will last up to four times longer. * Polyester suits lasts longer than chlorine tolerant fabric, and feels largely the same.
Swimsuits are currently in a “shrinking phase”, that is, getting smaller. Male briefs are becoming more thong like with very narrow side panels, female racing suits are getting cut much higher at the rear. You can find different cuts, but it can sometimes take a bit of work.
Never wring the water out of your swimsuit, it will weaken the fibres and seriously reduce its longevity. Simply squeeze it or use a suit spinner if there is one available.
Baggy board shorts should not be used. Beginner and many intermediate swimmers have problems with drag. Board shorts add even more drag and make improving your stroke even more difficult.
If you insist on using baggy shorts, please wear something tight underneath, because I have seen too many scrotums and assholes and I’m not even a paid professional.
How you look or feel in a swimsuit does not correlate with how well you swim.
There are three materials for swim caps: cloth, latex and silicone. Cloth is comfortable but otherwise useless, usually used by hotels to keep patrons from getting hair in filters. Latex lasts moderately well but snags hairs more. Silicone which is most expensive lasts longest but is also thickest and may be too warm for some people. No swim cap lasts for ever though. I never get more than a year from a cap.
Swim caps will last longer if your dry them between uses, and better yet sprinkle with talcum powder.
If you have a problem with the swim cap coming off your head while swimming, look for ones which have parallel ridges running around the inside edge.
Pool Hygiene
Pool swimming took a leap forward in the 1960s once reliable swim googles became widely available and training sessions for Olympic swimmers were able to last for 3000 metres or even a whole hour!
Goggles are essential for pool swimming because most pools use chemicals to make the water safe.
I have a longer post explaining the interactions of pool chemicals and people in more detail here
.
Pools that have a strong chlorine or chemical smell are LESS clean than pools that have little or no odour.  The less the chemical smell, the cleaner the pool water.
Pool-water colour has little relationship to pool water quality. Most pools use pool tiles to make the water look blue. Some even add small amounts of copper into the water for the same reason.
Just because you’ve read that swimmers pee in the pool doesn’t mean you have to. But if you do want to stay being a swimmer, you should probably reconcile yourself to the fact that you are absolutely swimming in dilute urine. If this is really troubling you, best of luck with your sex life.
It may not be chlorine that’s making your eyes burn. The pool may have the wrong water acidity (high or low). Soda-ash is added to pool water to control this.
Of course, if there are too many organics (sweat, urine etc) in the pool, then more chlorine must also be added to balance the pool.
Food & drink & peeing
Cold air in the pool deck or changing rooms, cold showers etc, evaporation of water from skin all cause the skin temperature to drop. This raises blood pressure as less blood flows and the hormone that suppresses urination is reduced. All this causes you to need to pee more. It’s completely normal.
Therefore swimmers need to be more careful about hydration. Experienced swimmers will always drink during training.
Yer Mammy was wrong. You can swim after eating.  All marathon distance swimmers like myself have to eat/take nutrition during swims for example. However, your body will be using air to digest food and use energy for exercise at the same time, so you will feel sluggish at best.
Effort & Diet
It is extremely common that new swimmers, regardless of or more likely due to prior experience in other sports, underestimate the overall difficulty of swimming and overestimate how much energy they are expending. If you haven’t mastered breathing and are desperately out of breath this does not mean you expending significant energy.
Calorie consumption rates in swimming given by website, apps or wearable fitness trackers or watches cannot be trusted because the variables are too varied. Weight, water temperature, stroke, experience, rests, set and session duration all play a part. I could say it’s almost certainly less than what any of those are telling you for an hour swimming.
Pools are lower than body temperature and conduct heat away. So your body does start using energy to retain heat. The effect lasts after the swim is over. This makes swimming an appetite enhancer. Swimmers notoriously eat a lot. For beginner swimmers, you need to learn to control this.
Most people with a good but average diet will have sufficient energy in blood and liver stores to sustain two hours of high intensity exercise. So it is not essential to “pre-load” in advance of daily swimming
How much should you swim?
How much you should swim depends obviously on your goals. However since swimming is technically difficult skill, it is safe to say than more swimming is better.
But how much? As a general guideline I recommend four times a week, 2000 metres at a time is a good aim. Beginners won’t be able to swim anywhere near this distance, so let’s say 40 minutes a session.
Injury & other physical problems
“Swimming is low impact sport, with little chance of causing injury“. This is a widely repeated misconception. Apart from the obvious, front crawl injuries to the shoulders do occur, caused by overuse and poor technique. You can get injured with only a small amount of swimming.
The best ways to reduce the risk are to improve your technique and ALWAYS do a little backstroke each session. Backstroke is a stabilising exercise for front crawl. It helps strengthen the opposing muscles in the shoulder muscles to assist in keeping your shoulders balanced. It does not have to be a good technique to be effective.
Does sleeping on your side cause discomfort? The cause is almost certainly tendonitis. This will not get better by itself, or with rest or by reducing swimming. I recommend some deep tissue massage, direct icing and physiotherapy, in that order as required, with massage & ice fixing ninety percent of problems.
Water in your ear is easiest dislodged by bouncing on the heel of the leg on the same side as the water. If this doesn’t work, have a shower and stand with your ear up under the water. If this doesn’t work, try a drop of rubbing alcohol (surgical spirit). Wear ear plugs if this is a repeat problem.
Asthma prevalence is correlated to regular swimming. The simplest and most effective treatment is to use your Daily Preventer, that you may not want to use daily.
Chlorine sensitivity causes very runny nose, sneezing, sore, red or streaming eyes. The simplest and most effective treatment is to use a nose clip. They take about one day to get used to, and are 100% effective.
Okay folks, I'm off to the pool My log resest itself from last year's million metres and I'm once again back to the start.
Second small edit. Doubtless there will be questions. Since I'm in Ireland and I am going swimming, and it'll be llate late after I finish, I'm not going to be able to answer much, sorry. There are more than sufficient swimmers here now to be able to answer most any question.
Remember the best swimmer in the one having the most fun!
(Small edit: I've been asked about my flair here previously. Waay back in the early aeons of

when all the mods were different, the then mods applied flair to some contributors to indicate their expertise in particular areas. I was then the only Channel swimmer here at that time).

Don't Just Do It – A 5 Step Technique to Consistently Get in the Gym
Hey everyone,
The title pretty much says it. For a long time, consistency was the biggest problem I had with my workouts. I struggled because I would go all out for a couple of weeks, then get tired, quit, and have the same body I’d always had.
When I started studying psychology, both in college and on my own time, I realized that I could use what I was learning to help me work out more consistently. Since then, I’ve gained 40 pounds of lean muscle. Of course I eventually learned a lot more about training, but it all started with that consistency.
I wanted to write this guide to help anyone who’s struggling to make exercise a habit. It might also help people who have trouble getting their gym buddies to pony up and tag along.
The guide is split into two parts:
Part one covers the basic psychological tactics that you can use to make exercise a part of your daily routine – without relying on willpower
Part two puts those tactics together into a concrete plan. In 5 steps, you’ll come away knowing exactly how you can achieve your goals.
Part one tactics include chaining (connecting your workouts to other events that you know will happen), precommitments (planning to work out well ahead of when you actually go to the gym), rewards (how to use small, consistent rewards instead of large ones), and barrier reduction (how to get rid of what stops you from working out).
Here's
a quick overview infographic
of the 5 steps in part 2.
In step one, you'll set a specific, actionable goal that lends itself to a clear and specific path of action.
In step two you'll set subgoals, along with times to check in on your progress towards your ultimate destination
In step 3 you'll identify the specific problems that might stop you from achieving your ultimate goal
In step 4 you'll plan ahead, figuring out ways to address your specific roadblocks
Step 5 puts it all together. You'll come away with one piece of paper, your roadmap, that details exactly how you'll reach your destination
I hope you find this helpful!

fitness,https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/,6337,1620,A Linear Progression Based PPL Program for Beginners,"To start, a motivational quote:
Errybody wanna be a bodybuilder, but nobody wanna lift this heavy-ass weight.
R. Coleman.
Anyway, there seems to be a bit of a conflict between conventional training wisdom for beginners (3 day a week full body linear progression! SS/SL/Greyskull only!) and what beginners actually wanna do (in the gym every day, biceps and triceps, woo!). What I'm going to write here is an attempt to reconcile these two ideas and produce a sane way for a beginner to train more frequently and give the attention to the glamour muscles that they want, while also progressing in a correct, appropriate manner. To do this, I'm going to borrow wisdom from a few different programs and ideas. My goal is to provide an accessible program for beginners with enough volume to stimulate growth in the bro muscles, while also giving enough intensity in the main movements to elicit strength adaptations.
First, some nomenclature:
3x10 - in this case, it reads
three sets of ten repetitions
2x5, 1x5+  - this reads as,
two sets of 5, one set of at least 5, but as many as possible
(more to come on this later)
SS - this reads as
superset
(two exercises performed back to back with no rest in between.
SUPASET
)
BB -
barbell
DB -
dumbbell
WOAH, WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY ACCESSORY WORK AND MAIN LIFTS?
The main lifts are just the first exercises of the day, and these are always going to be done heavier than the other lifts of that day. The lifts that follow are accessory lifts, designed to build muscle, balance out weakpoints and improve your strength in the main lifts.
BUT I DON'T CARE ABOUT STRENGTH, I JUST WANNA BE JACKED AND TAN
Who doesn't wanna be jacked and tan, I mean honestly? But strength progression is important, especially as a novice, for making you more muscular. Generally speaking, the more you can lift, the bigger you'll be. Progressing your main lifts will also have carryover effects to your other lifts as well: if you can bench press 300lbs, you can sure as hell bet that you're not gonna be incline dumbbell pressing 20lbs. And who do you really think is gonna be bigger: the version of you who can bench 200lbs, or the version of you who can bench 300lbs?
WHAT IS LINEAR PROGRESSION?
Put simply, linear progression means that if you were to graph your weights, the line that you would end up drawing would be straight.
Like this
. This means that you need to add weight workout to workout, every workout. You can make progress very quickly this way
if you're a beginner
because your body doesn't need much stimulus to adapt. As you get more advanced, you need more stimulus and more time to adapt.
See this handy graph from Starting Strength to get a better understanding of what I mean.
WHAT IS PPL?
PPL is just the initialiasm of
push, pull, legs
or
pull, push, legs
(it really doesn't matter which). This will (typically) have you doing 3 workouts, 2 times per week.
Push
- this can just be thought of as moving things
away
from your body (think of a bench press)
Pull
- this can be thought of as moving things
towards
your body (think of a row)
Legs
- I'm not going to bother with an explanation here
WHY DO I NEED TO PROGRESS LIKE THIS?
Because of progressive overload
. Without this, you won't make any adaptations (strength gains or size gains).
You will always start the day with a heavy barbell exercise, and this is what you need to progress linearly (if you remember from above, this means add weight every session). Then afterwards you will follow up with higher repetition exercises, that are more 'bodybuilding' based.
WHAT IS THE PROGRAM?
It's 6 days a week. You can run it one of two ways:
PPLRPPL
or
PPLPPLR
(where R denotes a rest day) depending on your schedule and preferences: it really makes no difference. Personally, I would run the program in the Pull, Push, Legs order.
YOU SAY TO ADD WEIGHT LINEARLY, BUT HOW MUCH WEIGHT DO YOU ADD PER SESSION?
2.5kg/5lbs for upper body lifts (bench press, row, overhead press)
2.5kg/5lbs for squats
5kg/10lbs for deadlifts
Now, without further ado...
PULL
Deadlifts 1x5+/Barbell rows 4x5, 1x5+ (alternate, so if you did deadlifts on Monday, you would do rows on Thursday, and so on)
3x8-12 Pulldowns OR Pullups OR chinups
3x8-12 seated cable rows OR chest supported rows
5x15-20 face pulls
4x8-12 hammer curls
4x8-12 dumbbell curls
PUSH
4x5, 1x5+ bench press/4x5, 1x5+ overhead press (alternate in the same fashion as the rows and deadlifts)
3x8-12 overhead press/3x8-12 bench press (do the opposite movement: if you bench pressed first, overhead press here)
3x8-12 incline dumbbell press
3x8-12 triceps pushdowns SS 3x15-20 lateral raises
3x8-12 overhead triceps extensions SS 3x15-20 lateral raises
LEGS
2x5, 1x5+ squat
3x8-12 Romanian Deadlift
3x8-12 leg press
3x8-12 leg curls
5x8-12 calf raises
FINER DETAILS: AMRAP SETS AND PROGRESSION OF ACCESSORIES
So, the first movements are done for sets of 5, and the final set is what's known as an
AMRAP
set (As Many Reps As Possible). This doesn't mean that you can just YOLO it and push until you can't push anymore. By As Many Reps As Possible, it really means
As many reps as possible while still maintaining good form
. You don't really want to be grinding too many reps, since you want to keep rep quality high. If you want a good reason to keep rep quality high,
watch this recent video from Omar Isuf
. The point of the AMRAP set is that it really gives you a chance to test your limits, and if you're feeling good on a specific day, you can get in a couple of extra reps. But the real moneymaker from this comes in when you deload.
Progression of accessories
should be done as so: when you can hit 3 sets of 12 with good form, add weight. As long as you're in the 8-12 range for your sets then you're good. If not, lower the weight.
HOW DO I KNOW WHAT WEIGHTS TO START WITH?
I don't like the Stronglifts 5x5 idea of starting with the empty bar, because I think the empty bar is useless for training purposes if you're capable of lifting a lot more. The mechanics of a lift (especially the squat for me) change a lot with weight.
I would recommend starting with the bar, and gradually adding weight for sets of 5 until the bar slows down. Then back off 2.5kg/5lbs, and this is your starting point. So if you worked up to a 60kg bench press before the bar slowed down at all, start at 57.5kg.
WARMUPS
(idea courtesy of
/u/Gawd1
)
I'm a big believer in just practising the movement as a warmup. So you can use bench press to warm up for bench press. Or squats to warm up for squats. You get the idea. The goal of a warmup is to get blood into the muscles and joints that are going to be used, and also to start drilling the motor patterns into your body for form purposes. As an example, if you're going to be benching 200lbs as your top set for that day, your warmups could look something like this:
Empty bar x 10
95lbs x10
135lbs x5
185lbs x3
200lbs 4x5, 1x5+
Warming up is a very individual thing, however, so do whatever you want to get yourself prepared for the lifts. If you like foam rolling, great. If you like some dynamic stretches and things like clapping pushups, great. Do whatever you want to do. The only recommendation is that I would avoid static stretches before lifting.
REST
Rest as long as is needed between sets. For a general guideline, I would recommend:
3-5 minutes between your first exercise of the day
1-3 minutes between all your other exercises
Don't worry too much about rest times, and worry more about just getting all your sets and reps in.
FAILURE
Failure is part of life, and since lifting weights is a lot like life, failure is also part of lifting weights. At some point, you're going to fail. Failure can occur really for two reasons
not enough sleep, food or recovery: if you spent all night partying and chasing pussy with your wing man, Jim Beam, you're probably not gonna perform well in the gym. In this case, don't count it as a true failure and just try again next time when you're fresh
strength failure. This is when you've reached the limit of your progression. If you fail a session 3 times in a row (for example, if you fail to hit 3x5 on squats at 100kg 3 times in a row), you need to lower the weight.
This leads us to...
DELOADING
Deloading is exactly what it sounds like -- taking weight off the bar. Take 10% off your working weights (so a 100kg squat would go back down to 90kg), and work back up. This should give you a good chance to push things on the AMRAP final sets. If you got 2x5 and 1x6 at 90kg the first time round, you can bet your ass that you'll get more than 6 on your last set the second time round. And by the time you work your way back up, if you can hit 97.5kg for 2x5, 1x8, 100kg for 3x5 will be trivial.
MY GYM OR GARAGE DOESN'T HAVE XYZ, WHAT CAN I DO INSTEAD?
(this section as recommended by
/u/LaRivalita
)
So basically everything here is interchangeable, except the main lifts: the squat, bench press, deadlift, overhead press, bent over row. If you can do those in your gym (not in a smith machine) then you can make this program work. Treat it more as template than gospel. Some ideas for substitutions are the following (and if anyone has other suggestions, I'm happy to add them to the list!):
Pull substitutions
Seated cable rows can be replaced with dumbbell rows or t-bar rows
Face pulls can be replaced with rear delt flyes AND band pull aparts (not one or the other)
hammer curls and dumbbell curls can really be replaced by any curl variation: it's a curl, shit ain't that serious!
Push substitutions
incline dumbbell press can be replaced with landmine press
triceps pushdowns and overhead extensions can be replaced with any general triceps exercise: skullcrushers, lying triceps extensions, dumbbell triceps extensions, whatever you want to do
Legs substitutions
Leg press can be substituted with front squats
leg curls can be substituted with glute ham raises
calf raises can be substituted by nothing because who gives a flying fuck about calves anyway? (not srs, any kind of calf raise will be fine here)
HOW TO MODIFY THIS TO FIT YOUR GOALS
(this section as recommended by
/u/theedoor
)
If you want to lift heavy weights
There are a few things I would recommend here.
/u/theedoor
's advice of: ""for example, if you want to be focused a bit more on strength, replace 3x8-12 RDLs with 3x5 RDLs. Add weighted dips, and weighted chins-ups/pull-ups in the 3x5 range (with bodyweight back off sets)."" is brilliant.
If you want to lift heavy weights, then you need to lift heavy weights. I know this sounds stupid, but it makes sense. The more time you spend in the lower rep ranges, the better you're going to be in those rep ranges, so if you want to lift heavy weights then feel free to alter the compound movement accessories (so your presses, your pulldowns or rows, your romanian deadlifts or your leg presses) to be in the lower rep ranges. 3x4-6 is perfect for things like this. In my view, the isolation accessory movements should be kept in higher rep ranges, because joint wear and tear can creep in here, and getting a pump is fucking awesome.
Specificity is also pretty key if you want to lift heavy weights. If you want to be a good bench presser, then maybe incline dumbbell press isn't going to be
as specific
as doing a close grip bench press instead is. If you want to substitute some of the (again, compound) accessory movements for ones that more closely resemble the main lifts, then be my guest.
If you want to increase endurance
Keep the first exercise the same, up the rep range on everything else. 15-20 reps is a great range for increasing endurance.
If you just want to be jacked and tan
Keep things the way they are. There's enough volume and a decent enough mix of volume and strength to get you big as long as you're eating enough. If you feel a specific bodypart is lacking, throw in a couple of extra sets for it, ideally isolation (so think along the lines of pec deck or biceps curls, not bench press or rows), so that you're not adding too much systemic stress, which could affect recovery times.
WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT, FORM OR WEIGHT?
(idea courtesy of
/u/Nobody773
)
Both. Nobody got big benching 1 plate regardless of how good their form is. You should push the weights up and continue progressing as long as your form is
acceptable.
Demanding that your form is 100% perfect all the time as a beginner is just not possible, so as long as your form is acceptable and not injurious, then continue adding weight. As an unknown lifter once said: the best way to improve your form at 225lbs is to make 225lbs part of your warmup. I can guarantee that when you're squatting 315lbs for reps that your form at 225lbs is picture perfect.
THIS IS COMPLICATED, THERE'S A LOT GOING ON! HOW DO I KEEP TRACK OF THIS?
It's something I hadn't thought of, since I have a borderline-autistic savant memory for things I do in the gym, but
here is spreadsheet created by /u/Mobius000
which will make tracking this a walk in the park.
CAN I DO THIS PROGRAM WHILE CUTTING?
Sure! You can do anything while cutting, so try it out. I suspect that recovery may become an issue due to the volume, so if you are struggling to recover and feeling like shit, drop some of the volume: 3x8-12 becomes 2x8-12, for example. Taper the volume off as little as possible, and keep the volume for the main lifts as high as you can for as long as you can.
CAN I DO AB WORK ON THIS PROGRAM?
Yes. I would recommend doing ab work on your deadlift days and your squat days if you want to do ab work. Nothing major, just do a few sets of (weighted) planks or a few sets of ab wheel and some hanging leg raises.
NEXT STEPS
A few people have requested this, so I thought I would write out what I think logical next steps from here are. This is a
beginner
routine, for beginners. Intermediate and advanced lifters can't make linear progress like this anymore, and require some more advanced training in order to progress.
Questions courtesy of
/u/FattestRabbit
:
What are some signs that you may want to graduate from this program?
Put simply, when you're no longer a beginner. A beginner lifter is defined as someone who can make progress workout to workout: if you deadlift 100kg for 5 reps, then the next time you deadlift you'll be able to deadlift 105kg for 5 reps. Once this
linear
progression stalls out, and you take longer to recover between workouts because the weights are heavier (and therefore the systemic stress is higher), you become an intermediate lifter. An intermediate lifter is someone who needs ~weekly progression in order to maintain progress (programs like the Texas Method for example).
Can you adapt this program for 'intermediate' lifters? How far can this program take you if you upped the weights and moved more sets to 3x5-8 (instead of 3x8-12)?
Yes, you can adapt this program for more intermediate lifters, but I wouldn't like to try and formalise something like that. The more advanced you get as a lifter, the more you should be realising what things are beneficial for you, and figuring out what works for you, because everyone is a bit different. In the beginner stages, this stuff really isn't too important because almost any beginner will make progress doing almost anything. I would recommend looking at progression schemes that are in things like the
Texas Method
,
Madcows 5x5
and
5/3/1
for your main lifts and then just sticking with fairly similar accessory work: more volume almost always equates to better gains, provided you can recover from it.
Moving more sets to 3x5-8 wouldn't necessarily have a huge impact on your abilities to lift big weights in the main lifts, and heavier sets (in my experience) tend to impose more wear and tear on the joints. If you're an intermediate lifter then go for it, try it out, it may work for you. Intermediate lifting should be all about trying things for yourself and getting to know yourself better as a lifter.
What are some next logical programs to try after this one?
Texas Method, Madcows 5x5, 5/3/1, PHAT, PHUL,
/u/gzcl
's Jacked and Tan - any program designed towards intermediates that are in line with your goals. Pick something you think you'll have fun with: unless this shit is your job or you really want to compete seriously then just have fun in the gym and don't do something too retarded, and you'll probably stick to it better than something you hate, and go to the gym with more drive and intensity. I'm a big believer that consistent effort is probably the most important thing you can make sure of.
PowerliftingToWin
is a great resource for training information and programming information, so I would recommend reading a bunch there.
CAN I DO THIS ROUTINE ONLY ONCE PER WEEK?
You
could.
And that's all I'm gonna say. I wouldn't recommend it, because that'd put frequency of all the lifts at only once per week. If you can only run it once per week then I would recommend something like Greyskull LP, Stronglifts 5x5 or Starting Strength instead for increased frequency.",

Stats:
45, 5'5"", 120lbs (I was born into extreme poverty and malnourished as a child, which stunted my growth)
Goal:
To stay healthy, fit, and active for as long as possible, while avoiding injuries and minimizing impact/stress to joints.
Diet:
Primarily plant based (with lots of beans for protein!), and occasional fish/seafood (2-4 times/month). No meat otherwise, and no dairy (except for the rare ice cream treat; a pint can last months in my freezer). I've been doing 16:8 intermittent fasting for many years now, and am thoroughly loving it (it's not for everyone, so always check with a medical professional before you make any significant changes to your lifestyle).
Supplements:
None, except for daily calcium & Omega 3 pills.
Sleep:
6 hours a day, plus post-work naps as needed.
Misc:
Never drank, smoked, or used drugs. Don't like coffee/tea. I do enjoy the occasional smoothie, but otherwise primarily drink water.
Workout routine:
Monday/Wednesday/Friday - 50 min cardio (10K run on elliptical using HIIT program, getting my peak heart rate into the 170s)
Tuesday - arms/back/abs (3 sets of ~15 reps each)
Arms:
* barbell curl
* one arm cable curls
* reverse curl
* chin-ups

Back:
* lat pulldown
* back extension machine
* pull ups
* vertical row

Abs:
* hanging leg raises
* ab crunches
* decline crunches
Thursday - legs/abs (3 sets of ~15 reps each)
Legs:
* quad extension
* hamstring curls
* leg press machine
* calf machines (standing & seated)
Saturday - chest/triceps/abs (3 sets of ~15 reps each)
Chest:
* flat bench press
* incline bench press
* decline bench press
* chest fly machine
* dips

Notes: I don't use heavy weights in my bench presses since I'm not a powerlifter and I don't have a workout partner to spot me, so I've incorporated more exercises to compensate.

Triceps:
* triceps pushdown
* dumbell kickback
* overhead triceps extension
Other thoughts:
Still feeling great at 45, and am proud to have successfully maintained a 28"" waist size since my 20s despite working a full time desk job. I try to view food as fuel for my body rather than a treat for my taste buds, and I only eat when I feel hungry (I'm too lazy to count calories). I don't skip workouts unless I'm injured/sick/contagious.
Consistency
is key, but listen closely to your body, and go light on weights or take a break from a certain exercise if needed. Be sure to watch that form! Also, take good care of your teeth! I'm lucky to still have all mine, and I brush/floss/waterpik every day, plus I never skip a dentist visit.
Try to minimize stress in your life by being financially responsible and living below your means, and seek help for issues that you have trouble dealing with on your own. Simplify, simplify, simplify! Remove toxic people and non-value added activities from your life, and focus your energy on the things in your
circle of control
. You will be much healthier and happier!
Edit: Wow, this blew up. I forgot to mention, stretching is extremely important to me! I always stretch prior to working out, and I feel it has been beneficial to me so far. Also, this is just what has personally worked for me. I'm not a definitive authority on health and fitness, I just wanted to share my story. You should find what works for you, and stick with it.

I love it so much I made a tutorial (and looping GIFS to save you time!)","What is a lacrosse ball? How does it work?
When someone gives you a deep tissue massage, they use their palms/fingers/elbows to apply pressure to help relax tight muscles and make you feel better. A lacrosse ball is a fairly hard, dense ball about the size of a tennis ball that helps mimic this deep release massage with your own bodyweight.
The best part is that you could go to town on your
glutes and hamstrings
in a way that not even many massage-therapists will because of how intimate that area is. (When was the last time someone FIRMLY massaged your ASS? Right?)  So thats why I have one, to get free ass massages, haha. (No but seriously, it's great for the whole body.)
Lacrosse Ball Video
Here is the video I made for it.
But I know not everyone wants to watch a 6-minute video, although I tried to make it concise, so I made looping GIF's with my doggie to help save redditors precious time.
Lacrosse Ball GIFs
Gluteus Maximus
Piriformis
Hamstrings
(sit on hard surface and place under thigh)
Feet / Plantar Fascia
(hold onto something for balance)
Upper Back (Traps)
Triceps/Brachialis

(tack ball and straighten/bend elbow)
Gluteus Medius
(Static, just chill over it)
Deltoids & Upper Chest against wall (no GIF of this, it's in the video tho and it's worth mentioning that you could do it)
Lacrosse Ball Alternatives
If you don't have a lacrosse ball, you could use a tennis ball, baseball, softball, billiard ball, cricket ball, floor hockey ball, golf ball, spalding bouncey ball as alternatives. They don't work as well as the lacrosse one in some cases, but it's better than nothing and sometimes it may even be better!
Foam roller?
About a year ago I made a similar post showing
how I use a foam roller
with a video+GIFs to tackle very large areas of the body. A foam roller in combination with a lacrosse ball, is my peanut butter and jelly.
Edit:
Epiccc # of upvotes. Thanks guys.  I knew when I made the gifs, it looked a bit crazy with me staring at the camera... but... I was like, whatever, it is what it is I guess. I enjoyed making them though. The way I go about making them is by clipping a tiny section of me going from one direction to the other, putting it into photoshop (file-import video frames to layers), then from the animation tool bar, find the arrow to select all layers, then paste layers after last frame, then reverse pasted layers (this is in animation toolbar), delete middle frame and last frame cause those are redundant, and then export as video, upload to gfycat, rinse repeat. Oh and I use gfycat cause they were the first service that supported html5. (Imgur copied them long after.)",

TL;DR
Decided to get healthy, and in shape before I turned 30 years old, and did something about it. Lifted weights, counted my calories, and worked hard. No special diet program, just simple stuff that almost anyone can do.
Summary
A little over 9 months ago I looked at myself in the mirror (literally, and figuratively), and I didn't like what I saw. I was a 29 year old, very overweight, lacking motivation, and confidence. My energy levels were low, and I knew it was effecting my family (wife and kids). I was tired of it, and wanted to finally do something about it.
Phase 1: Lose Fat ASAP
March 2015 – June 2015 (3 months)
Eat Healthier, smaller portions
– I knew I was super over weight, so I needed to lose fat. I used
LoseIt App
, and counted everything that went into my mouth. I calculated my TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) using online calculators, and adjusted my calories about every 2 weeks.
Lift Weights
– I started lifting weights with a friend of mine who had already been lifting for a few years. He taught me the ropes, and helped introduce me to some starter routines. During Phase 1, I did a basic Push, Pull, Legs (PPL) routine. I split this between 4 days per week (M, T, R, F).
Light Cardio
– I did about 15 minutes of cardio 2-3 times per week after lifting weights, just for some cardiovascular health, and to help with the weight loss.
Macronutrients
– I aimed for about 200g Protein daily, and then didn't really count my carbs or fat.
Calories
– I ate anywhere between 1800-2000 calories a day.
Example Daily Meals
Meal #1, 4 egg whites, 2 eggs, cereal
Meal #2, 6oz. Chicken, sweet potato, veggies
Meal #3, Preworkout: Protein Bar
Meal #4, 8oz Protein, carbs, and veggies
Cheat Meal
– Every 7-10 days, I'd have a cheat meal. Note: NOT A CHEAT DAY. Just a meal. This meal I would eat whatever I wanted, as much as I wanted. Usually it'd be a couple greasy burgers, chinese, or a pizza. These meals gave me a little something to look forward too, and also helped push off my weekly cravings.
Favorite Meal
:
Qdoba
. You can get a LOT of protein packed into very little calories, if you order right. I love Qdoba.
Ending Weight
: 198 lbs.
Phase 2: Gain Muscle
June 2015 – October 2015 (3 months)
Eat a lot
– I like to eat, so this phase was much easier for me. I actually probably gained too much weight, too quickly, and I will be changing that in my future ""bulk"" phases.
Calories
– I aimed for about 3300-3500 calories per day.
Example Daily Meals
Meal #1, Lots of eggs (8-10), protein shake, and cereal
Meal #2, 8oz. Chicken, sweet potato, veggies
Meal #3, 8oz. Beef w/ noodles
Meal #4, Protein bar, PB&J Sandwich
Meal #5, 8oz Protein, carbs, and veggies
Meal #6, Before bed: Yogurt, or cottage cheese
Macronutrients
– My goal was about 220g-250g Protein per day, and filled the rest of my calories with carbs and fats.
Weight Training
– Because I had so much more energy, I added in another day in the gym. So I began going 5 days per week. I gained a lot of strength during this phase too, which I attributed to the amount of calories I was consuming, and better form/technique that I had been developing with the help of my friend.
Challenges
– People talk about dirty bulks vs. clean bulks. Dirty bulking is obviously easier, and much more enjoyable. You basically eat everything you see, without regard for anything. I probably fell somewhere in between dirty and clean. I think it's good to find a balance, because if you do it too dirty you'll end up gaining quite a bit of fat. Like I did.
Cardio
– None.
Favorite Meal
: Donuts for breakfast, and Burgers for lunch. Ya, not healthy at all, I didn't eat this every day.
Ending weight
: 232 lbs
Phase 3: Cut the weight, reveal gains
October 2015 – December 2015 (3 months)
Calories
– Basically went back to what I was eating in Phase 1. 1800-2000 calories per day. With a cheat meal every 7-10 days.
Trying to keep strength
– I really feel I have my routine, and form dialed in right now with my weight training. Currently I'm doing a split that is kind of a mixture of a PPL, and ""Bro-split"". I really like it, and I feel exhausted after every workout, which is good.
Cardio
– I try to do cardio once per week, but honestly I often skip it. I'm really trying to get more consistent, because I know that it's good for my cardiovascular health. But it just hasn't been top priority for me.
Current Weight
: 200 lbs.
Weight left to lose
: ~15 lbs.
What Motivated me?
Honestly my biggest motivation came from wanting to prove myself wrong. All my life, I've just accepted that I was overweight, and that it was pointless to try and do anything about it. I ate food for comfort, and when I was stressed. Every time I went to buy clothes, I dreaded it, because I knew nothing would fit ""just right"". I hated looking at myself in pictures, and always secretly felt embarrassed.
I wanted to prove to myself that I could do it, and that
it doesn't have to be complicated
.
So what's next?
Enjoy life more with my family, friends. Get out and do things that I could/wouldn't do previously. I just want to be the best I can for them.
Take my shirt off this summer, and feel confident!
Keep losing weight! I'm wanting to diet down to about 10% bodyfat, and then start another bulk phase. This time, doing it more clean!
After this time I've spent working on my diet and training, I've really gotten into bodybuilding, and I considering trying to compete in the future. I know I'm still a long ways away, and I'm pretty old to begin competing, but I don't care. I just want to give myself a new challenge.
Biggest thing I learned?
Failing is ok
– I had many days where I felt I had ""failed"". But I had to keep reminding myself why I was doing what I was doing. So the next day, I would just start over, with a clean plate, and get back on track. I had to remember that it was a ""marathon"", not a ""sprint"". Failing is ok, just get back up the next day, and move forward.
It doesn't have to be complicated or expensive
– Honestly the biggest thing I learned is that getting in shape isn't rocket science. No matter what anyone tells you. All these instagram fitness coaches, supplement businesses, and ""weight-loss magic"" sellers, are just trying to make money. Some of their products might assist, but none of them are a replacement for hardwork in the gym, determination/commitment, and a balanced diet. I didn't follow any ""special program"". I just stopped stuffing my face with food all the time, and starting going to the gym a few times per week.
Final thought.
Was it difficult? Yes, many days were struggles to go back to the ""old me"". Would I go back to how I was before? No way in hell.
For those interested, here is a simple breakdown of my current weight lifting program. I do this 6 days/week, Monday-Saturday.
Day 1: Chest, Quads
Day 2: Back, Hams, Glutes
Day 3: Shoulders, Arms

Edit 2: A couple more tips
Weigh yourself everyday!
A lot of people say not to do this, but I'm a firm believer in doing it. I believe it helps you get more familiar with your body, and how it works. You see, and understand the fluctuations in your weight throughout the week. If you only weigh yourself once a week, you could be weighing yourself when you're retaining a lot of water, or not retaining. And you could get discouraged if you are up a pound or 2 after a week of eating well. If you weigh yourself DAILY, then you see these fluctuations constantly. (e.g. of how my weight would fluctuate. I weighed almost every day for the last 9 months.)
Take at least 2 photos a week
, to track your progress. I can't emphasize this enough! The scale isn't always the best way to track your progress, as you can see from my progress pics. I weighed almost the same in my before, and after phase 2 pics, but my body composition was much different. If I had only relied on a scale, I could have been discouraged by this. But I had plenty of pics to look back and see.",

Before and after:
https://imgur.com/gallery/A3hwN
I grew up being a fat kid my whole life. Up until I was about 18. I tried to avoid any kind of physical activities since I wasn't good at any sports nor interested.
Right before I finished high school, one of my friends asked me if I wanted to go to a gym with him and I just went without knowing what to expect. My first day at the gym was horrible. I remember using two 35lbs dumbbells to do a flat bench dumbbell press and thinking I was going to pass out after the 3rd rep. Since then, I've always been in and out of the gym. I did the typical bro split (chest/tris, back/bis, and etc). I didn't know what I was doing but since I was somewhat consistent, I didn't look ""fat"" anymore. Fast forward to summer of 2014, my clinical depression (got diagnosed way back in the day so I've had it pretty much my whole life) hit me harder than usual and I just dropped everything. I flunked all my classes, ate whatever &amp;amp;amp;amp;whenever and  slept when I wasn't eating. Fast forward to December 2014, I went to my mom's house for Christmas dinner and decided to weigh myself to find out that I gained 35lbs in span of 5 months(and I wasn't working out at all during that time so I'm assuming it was 35lbs + how much ever muscle mass I lost).
I decided that enough was enough and started dieting again on New Years. For diet, I carb cycles which worked really well with my carb cravings and 3 day split that I was running. I didn't really count my calories since I was tracking my macros instead but it usually went like this.
My macros were:
Day1(rest) 50c/30f/200p (1250-1300kcal)
Day2(push) 150c/30f/200p (1800-1950kcal)
Day3(pull) 150c/30f/200p (1800-1950 kcal)
Day4(legs) 300c/60f/200p (2200kcal)
Every 8th day of my high carb day, I had a ""cheat meal"" but tried to stay on healthier side instead of binging on calorie condensed food (deep fried, sweets, and etc. but I did treat myself to milkshakes from time to time). I didn't really do any cardio during my cut just because I was lazy.
Routine:
https://www.jefit.com/routines/workout-routine-database.php?id=22104
I ran this for a while but also took time away from dieting when I was on vacation and enjoying summer. From fall of 2015 until August of 2016, I fluctuated back and forth between 185-195. In September, I was sitting at 185, not happy with how much mass I had I decided to ""mini-bulk"" up to 195 before cutting again. I'm not sure if that bulk did much at all but I started my cut again in October same carb cycling but upping my fat to 60 per day while dropping my protein according to my body weight.
Routine now:
https://bodymaxing.com/2016/09/15/dltbb-routine/
I'm sitting at 179-180lbs right now hoping to cut maybe 5lbs before I reverse diet or maintain. But I'm pretty happy with my result so far. It took me longer than some people's transformation, but I enjoyed myself when I wanted to and made it work with on my own time. Someone once told me, ""your fitness journey is not a sprint, but a marathon. So as long as you stay consistent and never give up. You'll get to your destination."" And it really helped me out a lot when I was in doubt or feeling down with how I looked.
Thank you for reading and again, sorry about the format and grammar.
Edit: whoa, thank you all for compliments, advices and just responding in general. I didn't expect this post to blow up!
Yes, my mirror is dirty... I do clean it often, but when I wash my face, I splash water everywhere... I'll clean it more often 😭😭.

A little backstory.
It all started a few years ago when I went to the bowling alley with a group of friends and I was unable to curl the 8lb ball. Pretty big eye opener that made me want to hit the gym. I thought at first it would be nearly impossible, but my buddies gave me a hand and were my gym partners from that day on. My goal weight is 155 pounds and hopefully someday I'll reach that goal. Regardless I am pretty content with this transformation.
Edit 1
: I see that I must provide more information to how I achieved this transformation. I will provide one soon.
Edit 2
: Sorry work got a little busy, anyways.
First and foremost I ordered this
weight gainer
to help me gain some mass. To my embarrassment, yes the picture on the left was weighing at approximately 100 lbs. That was during the time I just ate once or twice a day. I changed that eating lifestyle to eating at least 4 time a day with two protein shakes, one in the morning and one before bed. I also took some preworkout (Jack3d, C4) to give me that boost of energy necessary to rep some weights.
As far as for workouts and reps, my buddies were my trainers. So I will try my best as to what exactly they made me do each day. I found this on my notes on my phone.

I got rejected by a very cute girl on March 10, 2016. Later that night, as I lay on my bed covered in a greasy sauce from the pound of Buffalo Chicken Cheese Fries I had just devoured, I took one last sip of my Green Tea Arizona and decided it was time for a change. I climbed down from my bunk bed and had my roommate take pictures of my sulking ass. The rest is history. 
When I posted that progress picture to instagram, I got a flood of questions from my friends asking how they can do the same. Instead of answering the same question 100 times, I made a google drive folder with all the info they'd ever need:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Y8MmU9NVxdFgeKU5cB-oM8TVUgnESCh4
PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE MY POST FOR LACK OF INFORMATION, THE DRIVE HAS IT ALL
This includes my
diet plan, my routines
, and a quick rundown of my 2 year journey and what I learned about bodybuilding. Take note, I'm a very straightforward, no bs type of guy, so what I wrote in that 13 page manuscript is a hard, honest opinion on what I believe is necessary to seriously pursue bodybuilding. If you want to know how to truly start bodybuilding without wasting time sifting through Bro-Science, it's all in my ""How To Get Swole"" document. I also have a potty mouth, but that's something you're gonna have to deal with.
With that being said: I was 18 years old and started at 121 lbs, 19% body fat. I only gained about 20lbs of lean body mass, which goes to show how much of a trial-and-error process this has been. I was in a weird grey area of body composition, being skinny fat. I was weak and fat, so I didn't know whether to bulk or cut first. I tried cutting first and that was a huge mistake. I then decided to bulk and focus on strength gains, and everything took off from there.
I started with Strong Lifts, going from benching the bar for 5x5 to benching a plate for 5x5. I did this for about a year until I could squat and deadlift 2 plates for 5x5.
My second year of training, I started incorporating accessory lifts. I made a Push Pull Leg style routine, putting shoulders on my leg day due to excessive fatigue on my push days. I did 2 days on one day off. I made the mistake of dirty bulking my first year, so I decided to start cutting. I counted calories and macros, and got to about 13% body fat before I gave up and blew right back up to 16%. I finally decided to start a serious cut, getting down to about 11% which took 5 months of strict dieting.
Now that I'm as lean as I've ever been, I plan on starting my very first lean bulk in preparation for my first bodybuilding competition. I have about a year and a half to train, so I plan to bulk until January 3rd, allowing myself about 16 weeks to cut before my show. I'm going to focus entirely on hypertrophy training. The routine is in the drive folder I posted earlier.",

​
Howdy
/r/fitness
!
I wanted to give you all an update on my journey to sobriety and wellness. It's 6 months in, and I am very proud to report that I'm still alcohol-free and still hitting the gym.
​
Here are my 6 month before/after photos (Kinda NSFW I suppose)
https://imgur.com/a/poInCR9
Height: 5 ft 5 inches
Age: 28
Pounds lost: 30 (165-135)
Bodyfat: 11.5%
​
Exercise Routine
Not long after my original post, I maxed out my small gym's dumbbells (they went to a max of 50 pounds), so I switched to a new routine that places major emphasis on bodyweight and HIIT training:
Workout A:
Dips, Pike Pushups, Push Ups, Step Ups, Pistol Squats, Dragon Flags, Suspension Tricep Extensions
Workout B:
Pull-ups, Suspension Rows, Suspension Curls, Suspension delt flies, Active hangs, Planks, Dumbbell Deadlifts
I run this routine twice/week, with a rest day in the middle: A, B, rest, A, B, rest, rest. I do workout on an empty stomach though, as I believe (with absolutely no data to back it up lol) that it helps with burning fat off.
All exercises are 4 sets of 20 (except for the Dragon Flag - if I can get 3 sets of 2 or 3, I'm thrilled haha). For some of them, such as pull-ups, I'll try my best to get 20, but usually, fall short. I try to keep my heart rate up, so I usually power through the workout in 30 minutes or less. I recently bought a 40 lb weighted vest though, so that's causing me to do less reps (10)
​
Diet:
My diet hasn't changed much, but on the recommendation of many Redditors, I stopped with the Lean Cuisine and started meal prepping fresh meals.
Goal caloric intake – 1,800 cals/day, but I usually get around 1,400 to 1,600.
Macro goals – 150+g protein, under 160g carbs, under 60g fat.
Breakfast – Breakfast shake (Greek yogurt, protein powder, bananas, fresh fruits, almond milk, and flax seed)
Lunch – One chicken breast with 1 cup cooked brown rice
Snacks – Optimum Nutrition Whey Protein (2 scoops), Apples, Oranges, Pears, etc
Dinner – Flexible, just as long as it fits my macros (Usually a home cooked meal though, my favorites are Pork Tenderloin or Shrimp Stir Fry)
Pre-bed snack – Carrots, Celery, or the occasional can of Tuna (although once in a while I cheat and have ice cream or of chips...gotta cheat once in a while to remain sane!)
Supplements:
Protein – Optimum Nutrition Whey Vanilla Ice Cream (2 scoops) daily
Creatine – Six Star 100% Creatine Monohydrate (5g) daily
Multivitamin – CVS brand One-a-Day Men’s Health Multivitamin (1 pill) daily
PreWorkout – Six Star Explosion Ripped (1 scoop) only on lifting days
​
As a side note - you all have been a huge help in my reaching my goals. The level of motivation and knowledge that I gain here is amazing. Thank you all for making my ongoing transformation possible.",

Here is my summary to meet Rule 2 of
r/Fitness
:
TL;DR/Top Ten Changes I've Personally Made From These Lessons:
There's a million bits of info in these notes, but here's some ten takeaways I was able to implement over the course of two months.
Carbs:
Carbs are not the enemy, but need to be heavily regulated and based on individual performance, digestive health, and body-fat. Ethnic background is a huge factor. That being said, Charles states ""you need to earn your carbs,"" while Stan is more lenient, but still recommends you keep them low if you're not an elite athlete. If you do choose to eat carbs, white rice is the best carb as it doesn't cause inflammation or digestive issues like potatoes and brown rice can.
Sleep:
The greatest anabolic, absolutely necessary. The elite performers sleep 10-12 hours a day, including long naps during the day. Important to muscle growth, fat loss, and hormone regulation. I dim the lights 2 hours before bed, do my best to not check my phone, tv, or any electronic screen to improve sleep quality.
Programming:
I've split my workouts with 72-hours between muscle groups. Using a variety of exercises helps overall performance by choosing accessory work that addresses weaknesses. ""Exercise rotation and having a big exercise library prevents injury while allowing constant key movements."" Only 4 main heavy days, with the other days as options for accessory or cardio.
Food choice:
Grass-fed meat research isn't proven yet, and doesn't justify the price. Eat quality cuts of beef, bison, and wild game. ""Otherwise, the best diet is the one you stick to."" Just eliminated processed foods and snacks, and choose vegetables and fruits that the body will digest easily (
FodMap
). Bought a sous-vide to prepare the Costco Steak, and a rice maker for the white rice. On it for two months and am seeing great results. Personally, I've added lots of berries, avocadoes, baby carrots, nuts, coconut oil, chia seeds to my daily diet. I also add kimchi and guacamole to some meals in order to keep the steak from being too routine. Also drinking 3oz of OJ multiple times a day.
Warm-Up:
Stretching is apparently a waste of time, and cardio before your lift will cause you to be insulin resistant, preventing fat loss. Either do potentiation exercises, or follow this advice: ""brain should know the range of motion, and weights should get heavier."" Regarding potentiation: find where the weakest links are in the main lift, then pick a moderately light weight, and choose exercises that affect different muscle groups involved in the main lift. For example, the squat might be upper back (a), lower back (b), then hamstrings (c). Doesn't need to be heavy, just consistently volume with minimal rest. 4x25 with no rest: a, b,c, repeat 4 times total. Then rest 3-5 minutes, then you're ready attack the main lift (be if your heavy max or speed work). Matt noticed clients were getting stronger, and form was getting better over time. Matt started off light, but now can do 4x25's of 100lb dumbells on chest warmups. Work your way up.
Walking:
Not just for old people: Ten minute walk, after you eat a meal. Improves digestion, decreases DOMS, helps with insulin sensitivity. ""Blood is the life force, brings in all the nutrients."" Brisk walks with elevated heart outperforms leisure 10k step-walks in fat, heart, cardio benefits. Recommended is 3 ten-minute walks a day. Can replace all steady-state cardio with walks and HIIT. Recommended them to the women in competition and strongmen like the Mountain, both of whom saw fantastic results.
Cardio:
Implemented rucks over distance running, along with adding swimming, cycling, and farmers carries. Long slow-distance work inhibits muscle growth
and
fat-loss. That said, some cardio is required, hence the HIIT, farmers walks, etc as they are recommended. Still learning to program into the workout regimen.
Build the Backside:
If the muscle is behind you, chances are you need to build it stronger. The average person will have weak lower and upper back, hamstrings, glutes, calves, traps, rear delts, etc. Build those up by making them a priority in your accessory exercise selection. For example: Upperback not strong enough will change scapular position on bench press.
Salt:
Upped the intake of my salt. Iodized salt, stimulates thyroid, immune system, stimulates the liver. When you hit a wall, it's because you're low on sodium, not carbs. Guaranteed. Single biggest thing you can do to impact performance, stamina and endurance at the gym is iodized sodium.
Post-workout drink:
Body super-compensates after a workout, so you need immediate replenishment, especially for two-a-days. Fructose (Orange juice) for liver stimulation, dextrose (scoop off Amazon) for glycogen replenishment, sodium (600mg), 100mg of caffeine (accelerates all of that). No proteins or fats immediately as it slows absorption.",

TL;DR Was fat, am not anymore.

Just wanted to talk to you a bit about my transformation in the last 2 years. It was a hell of a rollercoaster.
In May 2015, I had enough. I was feeling sick, I was 24 and supposed to be in my prime. But at 340 pounds and 5’11’’, it was not the case.
So I decided to change. I went on the subreddit
r/loseit
and learned how to lose weight by counting your calories.
And it worked.
In the first week I lost 17 pounds. Sure, a lot of it was water but God did it give me motivation to continue. The second week, I was 10 pounds lighter. It really worked.
So I counted my calories until I was around 215 pounds. By then, I had lost 125 pounds in around 7 months.
While I was doing this, I decided to do the C25K (
r/C25K
) to help me start running. I ran my first 5K while I was weighing 275 pounds. It was slow, so very slow, but I did it. I was SO proud of myself. I was working on becoming a healthier person.
That’s when I saw one of my childhood friend who is a gym rat. He was so proud of me and asked me if I was going to the gym. I was, but I did not follow any program. I was still doing some “FuckArountIt”, meaning I didn’t know what I was doing. So he helped me to do a basic program.
3 Days Split PPL
LEGS
Cardio 20 minutes
Squat 4 x 8
Lying Leg Curl 4 x 8

Deadlift 5x6
OHP 5x8
Shrug 4x8
Barbell Row 4x10
Glute-Ham raise 4x8

With this new program in the gym, I then started to follow something like LeanGains (
r/leangains
) in counting my macros.
Training days 1800 Calories High Protein, High Carbs, Low Fat.
Rest Day 1500 Calories High Protein, Low Carbs High Fat.
And I continued to shed some fat. It was slower, of course but progress kept on going. I stopped after 11 months at 172 pounds lost. I was weighing 168 pounds and was pretty skinny.
https://i.imgur.com/c4BEQyK.jpg
At this point, I started going to maintenance a bit, around 2200/2400 calories. It was summer so I went in vacation, had fun and enjoyed my new shape. I even did a 21k for fun with a friend.
So, here we are. 168 pounds, able to run 21k, going to the gym 3 to 4 time a week. Eating 2200 calories a day. What was I going to do now?
It’s Bulk time. To do this, I changed my 3 day Split PPL a bit.

As for my macros, it looked like this:
Training Days 2900 Calories, High Protein, High Carbs, Low Fat
Rest Days 2100 Calories, High Protein, Low Carbs, High Fat
I bulked from October 2016 to March 2017 and put on around 20 pounds.
https://i.imgur.com/2HYDCcJ.jpg
So in March, I started a cut to shed a bit of the fat that I got while doing this lean bulk. I finished it in June at around 175lbs. I was doing the same program. Just added some cardio 3 days (10k).
As for the macros: 
Training Days 2100 Calories, High Protein, High Carbs, Low Fat
Rest Days 1700 Calories, High Protein, Low Carbs, High Fat
https://i.imgur.com/Zh6lK9K.jpg
Since then, I’ve switched to nsuns 5days program and upped my calories to go into maintenance/recomp. I’m still getting leaner so I guess everything is going great.",
