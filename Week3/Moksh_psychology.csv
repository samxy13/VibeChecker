LSD and SSRIs.
Its seems that, by changing ones mental configuration, the placebo effect does the rest. If the placebo effect is powerful in physical illness, it appears at least doubly so in mental illness. This little caveat has been (for decades) and continues to be exploited by Big Pharma for profit, bringing about the generational pseudo-science of psychiatry -- an ultimately illogical and demonstrably un-scientific house of cards that will be looked upon by more advanced generations as having as much legitimacy as phrenology or astrology.
For better or worse, the primacy of the Mind and its vast potential for self-definition as a sovereign entity, outside the stifling and nonsensical bounds of ""chemical balance,"" reclaims its throne.
Quotes from the article:
""The major new umbrella review – an overview of existing meta-analyses and systematic reviews – was published on July 20 in the journal Molecular Psychiatry. It suggests that depression is not likely caused by a chemical imbalance, and calls into question what antidepressant medications do.""
“Many people take antidepressants because they have been led to believe their depression has a biochemical cause, but this new research suggests this belief is not grounded in evidence.”
""There is also evidence that believing that low mood is caused by a chemical imbalance leads people to have a pessimistic outlook on the likelihood of recovery, and the possibility of managing moods without medical help. This is important because most people will meet criteria for anxiety or depression at some point in their lives.""",

We think that hyperactive brain regions might stay awake in the otherwise sleeping brain. This would explain why many people with tinnitus experience disturbed sleep and night terrors more often than people who don't have tinnitus.
Tinnitus patients also spend more time in light sleep. Simply put, we believe that tinnitus keeps the brain from producing the slow-wave activity needed to have a deep sleep, resulting in light and interrupted sleep.
In future research, both the sleep stage and tinnitus activity in the brain could be tracked at the same time by recording brain activity. This may help to find out more about the link between tinnitus and sleep and understand how tinnitus may be alleviated by natural brain activity.",
