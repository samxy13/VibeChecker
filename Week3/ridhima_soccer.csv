From now on The Sun will no longer be a source allowed on the sub.
The Sun as a publication has been boycotted by 70 sets of fans of English clubs over the coverage of Hillsborough and other pieces of coverage. Clubs themselves have also joined in this protest by banning the publication from conferences.
We firmly believe that nothing of value will be lost here. The news covered will generally be found at other sites instead.
This ban is not related to the quality and reliability of content from The Sun, and we are not looking to ban any sources based on those criteria. The reliability and content quality of sources should still be governed by the community using upvotes and downvotes.
We'll update everyone in a few days about the rest of the meta thread, just thought this is worth its own post first as it would obviously dominate the comments, which is understandable.",
