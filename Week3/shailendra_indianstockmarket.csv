indianstockmarket,https://old.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1lstvt0/he_retired_at_45_with_47_crore/,9460,777,He retired at 45 with ₹4.7 crore.,"This was my uncle. Never had a flashy job, never built a business, never traded stocks. Just a boring job that paid decently.
When I was 24 and barely saving anything, he just said,
""You don’t need to earn more. You need to save early.""
I didn’t get it. He lived in the same 2BHK for 30 years. Rode a scooter. Vacations? Kerala once. He made no extra income. No side hustle. Nothing.
But what he did was simple.
Put 10,000 into a mutual fund in 1998. No one around him was doing that back then.
A couple of years later, he started a 500 SIP. Whenever his salary went up, he increased it. 1000, then 2000, then 5000.
By 2010, he was putting in ₹20,000 a month. He never stopped.
When he retired at 45, I asked him how he pulled it off.
He handed me his passbook and a sheet he printed from CAMS.
The total corpus: 4.7 crore.
I was stunned. He still lives in the same 2BHK. No upgrades. No show.
But now he and my aunt are out travelling almost every weekend. Kids have no idea about his net worth.
He’s my go to for anything practical in life. And honestly, he’s the only real inspiration I’ve needed.",

He built Berkshire from a dying textile firm into a $1.16 trillion powerhouse owning giants like Geico, Duracell, and Dairy Queen  plus massive stakes in Apple, Coca-Cola, and Amex.
His successor? Greg Abel, a longtime Berkshire insider Buffett personally chose four years ago. Funny enough, Abel didn’t even know the handover would be announced at the annual meeting classic Buffett spontaneity.
Buffett said he won’t sell a single share and that all his holdings will go to charity.
From selling soda at 6 to donating billions at 94, Buffett’s story is capitalism’s most human version. Whether you agree with his value investing philosophy or not, his discipline and humility reshaped modern finance.
What do you think will Berkshire be the same without Buffett?",https://i.redd.it/z9fxks1mlk0g1.png

I am in my 3rd year of my college studying a degree in which I saw no future in..
In my college there's no mandatory attendance requirement if you maintain your CGPA above 9.0 so I never really attended any classes. Most of my time was spent on my laptop and deep-diving into the internet reading about how the world worked. Economics, market cycles, stocks, asset classes…it fascinated me endlessly.
One thing I understood early is if you want to make money, you need to notice things that others don’t. You need to identify patterns early and bet on them before the world catches on.
And then I noticed something big: Jio had just made the internet dirt cheap, and suddenly the whole country was online. People were watching, sharing, and connecting more than ever. The floodgates of online interaction had burst open.
But more than that, I noticed something shifting socially - particularly around sexuality. People in my own college were more open, liberated, and, to put it bluntly, a lot more sexually active. And this was just the beginning. I was seeing the early signs of what looked like a larger societal trend - a wave of sexual liberalization, fueled by internet access.
But how can I make money off this ?
That question lingered for a long time… until one day, I went to visit a friend living in a rented flat near college. In his room, I saw a pack of condoms lying around out in the open.
And that’s when the thought hit me like lightning. Wait a second… if everyone’s having more sex and society is opening up about it.. who’s going to profit from this?
I rushed back to my room, fired up my laptop, and started researching condom manufacturers in India. Most of the big ones weren’t publicly listed. But then I stumbled upon a relatively lesser-known company called Cupid Ltd. They weren’t just making condoms, they were manufacturing female condoms (which were rare in India back then) and diagnostic test kits.
It wasn’t a blue-chip company by any means, it was just a smallcap company. But something about the business and the timing just felt right. So I did the dumbest-smartest thing a broke college student could do: I took every rupee I had around 4,500 rupees and bought shares in Cupid Ltd.
Today, that small 4500 rupees has almost 33Xed and the current value of that investment is 1,48,000 rupees.
It didn’t change my life financially, but it made me realise something - that being curious, observant, and willing to act can pay off big. Especially if you're willing to bet on trends before they become obvious.
Looking back today, this is one of the finest bets on future I made 😁",https://i.redd.it/koq4m41jkh6g1.jpeg

Now he lives in a PG at 37.,"I have this friend in Bangalore. We started our first jobs around the same time. I moved to Mumbai later, but he stayed back.
In 2018, he was doing well. 70K salary, living with friends in a 3BHK near Koramangala, always hanging out at Toit or some new rooftop cafe I couldn’t even pronounce. He had a Royal Enfield, a new iPhone, and I won’t lie, I felt jealous. He had everything I didn’t.
Once I asked him, Bhai, how are you affording all this? I get 50K, send money home, pay rent, food, transport. I’m barely managing a 10K SIP and feel broke. He said, “Just a few EMIs bro, it’s manageable.” That year he got a 15 percent hike. Went on a Bali trip while I went home to see my parents. Sent photos from a pool villa. Messaged us on the group saying, enjoy life, it’s too short.
In 2023, he got into trading. Started with intraday. Then full F&O. He quit his job saying this pays more and he doesn’t need a boss. One day, he called and said he made 30K in a single trade. He was teaching a few juniors how to trade options. Attended one of PR Sundar’s workshops. Came back fully hyped. Said this was the future. The real shortcut to wealth.
I lost touch with him after that. Just followed him on Instagram. Reels about F&O, screenshots of MTM gains, cafe pics with captions like work from anywhere.
Just last week, I met another colleague who used to work with us. Bumped into him near Lower Parel, and we ended up grabbing chai. We were talking about random stuff, old teams, where everyone landed up. Then suddenly he goes
“Bro, you remember ********?”
Of course I did. Said yeah, I still follow him on Instagram.
This guy just smirked. Said he’s finished. Blew up everything and is sitting on 42 lakh in loans. Borrowed from everyone he knew. Friends, family, even random people. He used to run Tele gram groups and take trading classes. Promised people he’d teach them how to make money. One of the guys he scammed ended up beating him up. Said he lost everything following his calls.
He was thrown out of his old flat for not paying rent. Moved to a cheap PG near BTM. No bike. No savings. Nothing. Just debt, fake screenshots, and Instagram reels pretending like he’s living the dream.
A perfect life doesn’t need enemies, just a few bad decisions and the wrong kind of confidence.",

Finshots
India exports generic medicines to over 200 countries. But nearly 70% of the raw chemicals called APIs that power those drugs come from China.
Back in the 1980s, India made most APIs and chemicals domestically. But high costs, stricter pollution rules, and cheaper Chinese imports pushed Indian pharma toward easier profits in finished formulations. So India mastered making and exporting the pills while China quietly took over the chemistry.
When COVID hit and China locked down, API prices for drugs like paracetamol and azithromycin exploded and exposed India’s dependency.
The government is now trying to rebuild local manufacturing with a ₹7,000 crore PLI scheme and bulk drug parks in Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, and Himachal Pradesh. But catching up with China’s decades of scale, policy support, and raw material control will take time.
India does not need to replace China, just reduce the risk.
Because when China sneezes, India’s pharmacy catches a cold.

At first, it felt surreal because of brilliant people, intellectually intense work, and the kind of compensation that almost doesn’t feel real when you’re in your early 20s. It was everything I had worked towards.
But over time, reality started settling in. The money gets better and I mean way better but so does the pressure. It’s not just long hours but it’s deep and demanding hours. You’re constantly solving complex problems, and you can’t just coast. You’re expected to bring your A game all the time. You live in a world where everyone is smart, sharp, and constantly pushing the edge.
I won’t lie, it takes a toll. Social life shrinks, time outside work feels like an afterthought some weeks, and burnout is always lurking around the corner.
And honestly I still like it. The pressure, the intensity, the kind of people I work with it’s a lot, but it pushes me in a way I never expected. I feel like I’m growing all the time, even if it comes at a cost.
I’m not sure how long I’ll keep doing this. Some days I wonder if it’s sustainable. But for now, this is where I am. And even with all the chaos, I don’t really regret it.
Just wanted to put this out there. Ask me anything if you're curious about life at Jane Street, the transition from IIT, or whatever else.
Throwaway account because I don’t want this tied to my real one and some folks I work with follow me here. Downvote if you want, not here for karma, just wanted to share a bit of what life’s been like.",

So here's the scenario: Start with ₹10K monthly, increase it by 10% every year (step-up SIP), invest for 25 years. Assuming decent 12% returns.
The numbers:
Total invested: ₹1.18 Cr
Final corpus: ₹4.28 Cr
Looks great right? ₹3.1 Cr profit!
Now add inflation (6% annual):
Real purchasing power of ₹4.28 Cr today: ₹99.62 Lakhs
Basically your ₹1.18 Cr investment is worth ₹1 Cr in today's money after 25 years
But wait, there's more - LTCG tax:
Government taxes the ₹3.1 Cr ""gain"" at 12.5%
Tax bill: ₹38.75 Lakhs
They don't care that most of that gain is just inflation
Real value after tax: ~₹80 Lakhs
So after 25 years of disciplined investing, stepping up contributions, and market ups and downs, your real purchasing power barely doubles.
Don't get me wrong, it's still better than letting money rot in a savings account. But calling SIP a wealth creation tool is overselling it. It's more like a wealth preservation tool with modest gains.
The system is designed to keep the middle class running on a treadmill. You invest to not become poor, not to become rich.
Am I missing something here or is this just the depressing reality?
edit: 
People pointed out I should account for inflation on the investment side too. Fair, but remember this is a step-up SIP by Year 25 I’m not putting in ₹10k, I’m shelling out nearly ₹1 Lakh
per month
. When you calculate the 'Present Value' of that massive outgoing cash flow, the actual purchasing power I sacrifice over 25 years is equivalent to ~₹47 Lakhs today. In return, after paying the 12.5% tax on the ""fake"" inflation gains, the final corpus is worth ~₹90 Lakhs in today's money. You give ₹47L to get ₹90L. That’s barely a 1.9x real multiplier after 25 years of grinding. My point stands: it's a preservation tool, not a get-rich scheme.",

He thinks AI companies are spending crazy money on GPUs, servers, and data centres… and using accounting tricks to make profits look better than they really are.
Most AI hardware becomes old in 2-3 years. But companies are pretending it lasts 5-6 years. When you stretch this on paper, your yearly costs look small, and profits look big.
Burry says this is creating a hidden bubble worth $176 billion.
His bet is simple: when the hardware becomes outdated and companies are forced to admit the real costs, earnings will fall and stock prices could crack.
Some analysts say he’s wrong and AI will easily justify the spending. Burry says investors are being too optimistic  just like the dot-com era.

The scale, the audacity, the evidence, it's all there in black and white.
But, worst part is that government regulators were allegedly feeding confidential information to outsiders who made massive profits while retail investors got crushed.
On July 23, 2025, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission dropped an announcement that they were implementing market coupling for India's power exchanges starting January 2026.
IEX stock crashed 29.58% the very next day, and the trading volume exploded from 92 lakh shares to 12.77 crore shares.
The retail investors holding the stock lost nearly a third of their investment overnight.
In all between all these drama, eight people were making the trade of their lives, as they bought put options in IEX days before the announcement, perfectly positioned to profit from the crash, and when the dust settled, they walked away with ₹173.14 crore in profits.
SEBI has named eight individuals in this case, and the profit distribution is wild. Bhoovan Singh topped the list with ₹72.04 crore in profits. Narender Kumar made ₹34.53 crore. Amita Soran pulled in ₹31.60 crore. Amar Jit Singh Soran made ₹22.65 crore. Virender Singh got ₹7.04 crore. Anita made ₹3.09 crore. Bindu Sharma made ₹2.19 crore. And Sanjeev Kumar is jointly liable with Bindu Sharma for her trades.
None of these people had traded in IEX before this.
Several of them had barely participated in the stock market at all. Then suddenly, in the week of July 21-28, 2025, 100% of their trading activity concentrated on IEX put options.
They bought puts at strikes ranging from ₹170 to ₹195, perfect positioning for the crash that was coming, and the moment the stock collapsed and they booked profits, they stopped trading again.
SEBI's investigation found out that Bhoovan Singh had access to internal CERC documents, such minutes of committee meetings that were meant for internal circulation only.
SEBI traced it to two CERC officials (their names are partially redacted in the order but they're identified as Official 1 and Official 2).
Official 1 was a Chief of Economics Division at CERC, and SEBI found extensive communication between her and Bhoovan Singh on the Signal messaging app where she regularly shared internal CERC information.
They even found that she had sent him her CERC job application form back in October 2023, showing they had a personal relationship.
On September 20, 2025, when SEBI conducted a search and seizure operation at Bhoovan's premises, Official 1 sent him a copy of IEX's appeal against the CERC order via WhatsApp.
The real stuff was Sanjeev Kumar's visit to CERC on July 15, 2025, eight days before the order went public.
He went to CERC headquarters and met multiple officials including both Official 1 and Official 2, and he sent a photo to a WhatsApp group showing he was watching a live stream of a CERC board meeting from the IT room adjacent to the boardroom.
Who gets access to live streams of confidential regulatory meetings?
When NSE flagged these suspicious trades on July 31, 2025 and asked Bhoovan to explain his trading rationale, he panicked. He deleted his WhatsApp chats with Official 1.
But, he forgot to delete the chats on Signal and other messaging apps.
SEBI recovered everything during their search and seizure operation. They found his search history researching the impact of the CERC order, strategies to benefit from the announcement, and even queries about how to enable derivative trading in his account.
This guy was literally Googling how to profit from insider information.
As of today, all eight individuals are banned from buying, selling, or dealing in any securities. Their bank accounts have been frozen to the extent of their alleged profits.
If internal CERC committee meeting minutes are being casually shared on WhatsApp and Signal with outsiders, what else is leaking?",

That means if the seller or vault partner shuts down, you have no legal claim over your gold. It’s stored with private vault operators and refiners, not under any government-backed system.
Here’s what most investors don’t realize:
• 3–6% buy–sell spread (you lose money both ways)
• 2–3% indirect storage or making charges
• Only 5-year holding limit (after that, you must sell or convert to physical  and that adds cost)
• GST and delivery fees if you convert to actual gold
Even though it’s marketed as easy gold investing, SEBI’s warning makes it clear that it’s risky, unregulated, and fully dependent on private companies.

Client got impressed with the work. Offered full time position. Remote working. Registered as IT start-up, US client - All invoices are submitted under LUT ( No TDS, No GST ). Monthly invoice amount - approx 4.5 lacs, Yearly let's round it to 50 lacs.
4 family members - all are working for the company as employees ( including founder ). 
Everyone contributes in accounting, admin, development.
Each family member gets exactly 8 lacs annual salary. Each one of them files ITR under old regime, takes advantage of 80c, 80d and other tax saving schemes. Bring tax amount down to 20k each ( 80k aoprox in total )
So fa, 8 lacs * 4 = 32 lacs... Approx 80k tax paid.
One more IT fresher employee at 18k - 20k monthly salary to manage workload
50 - 32 - 2 = 16 lacs balance in company current account.
All major expenditures are carried through these 16 lacs - Buying electronic gadgets, petrol, hotel bills, travel expenses, etc. obviously as company expenses
At the end of financial year - current account balance is kept to minimum. It order to avoid tax on profit. If there is budget available - employee is added.

indianstockmarket,https://old.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1pq27q4/exposing_mutual_funds/,987,198,Exposing Mutual Funds!!!,"I recently did the math on a
25-year step-up SIP
, and it genuinely challenged the way SIPs are marketed in India.
The Common Scenario
Monthly SIP: ₹10,000
Annual step-up: 10%
Duration:
25 years
Expected return:
12%
Inflation assumption:
6%
LTCG tax:
12.5% (no indexation)
On paper, it looks amazing.
Total invested comes to around 1.18 crore.
Final corpus around 4.28 crore.
Looks like a 3.1 crore gain. This is the version most SIP calculators and influencers stop at.
But once you start thinking in terms of purchasing power, the story changes.
First big mistake I realized people (including me earlier) make is mixing timelines. You can’t add 2025 rupees and 2049 rupees together and treat them as equal. Same with tax. The tax isn’t paid today, it’s paid 25 years later, so it needs to be discounted too.
When you adjust the 12% return for 6% inflation, the real return is about 5.6%. Still positive, but nowhere near what “12% CAGR” sounds like in your head.
Then comes the contributions. That 1.18 crore number isn’t 1.18 crore of today’s value. Your later SIPs are huge in nominal terms, but in today’s purchasing power they’re much smaller. When you adjust all contributions back to today’s value, the real amount you’ve put in is closer to 60–65 lakh.
The final corpus of 4.28 crore, when adjusted for inflation, is roughly 1 crore in today’s money.
Now the tax part, which is where I initially messed up. The LTCG tax looks scary at 38–39 lakh, but that’s in future rupees. When you discount that back by inflation, the real tax burden is more like 9 lakh in today’s terms.
So net-net, in real purchasing power:
You put in roughly 65 lakh worth of value over 25 years.
You walk away with about 90–95 lakh worth of value after tax.
That’s around a 40–45% increase in purchasing power over 25 years.
Which brings me to the uncomfortable conclusion.
SIPs aren’t useless. They do what they’re supposed to do. They stop your money from quietly dying to inflation. They force discipline. They’re way better than FDs or savings accounts, which are basically guaranteed wealth destroyers after tax.
But calling SIPs a “wealth creation tool” feels like overselling it. They won’t change your class. They won’t make you rich. They just make sure you don’t fall behind.
The part that genuinely bothers me is the LTCG tax without indexation. You’re paying tax on inflation gains, not real gains. That drag compounds quietly over decades, and most people don’t even notice it because everything is shown in nominal numbers.
My current takeaway is this:
SIPs are a base, not a strategy.
They’re about survival and stability, not transformation.
If your income stays average, SIP alone won’t save you. You need income growth, career leverage, maybe business or concentrated equity bets on top. SIP just makes sure whatever you earn doesn’t rot.
Curious how others here see this. Do you still think SIPs deserve the “wealth creation” tag, or are they more of a “don’t get poorer” tool dressed up with nice CAGR numbers?",

indianstockmarket,https://old.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1olkess/congratulations_you_now_own_lenskart_shares/,975,123,"Congratulations, you now own Lenskart shares — whether you wanted them or not!","It seems almost impossible to get away from getting allotted shares of Lenskart somehow.
Yesterday, I wrote an email to one of the mutual fund houses where I’ve been SIPing for quite some time. I noticed that one of their schemes is participating in Lenskart’s IPO, and I couldn’t stay silent. In my email, I mentioned that such investment decisions raise serious concerns about the fund’s evaluation standards and the prudence of its management. As a result, I’ve lost confidence in their decision-making process — and I’ve actually stopped my SIP and started redeeming my investments from that scheme.
I’m honestly disheartened by how our money is being taken for granted. Although, I wasn’t completely upset since I had already been planning to rebalance my all-equity portfolio by adding some exposure to debt mutual funds, given my cautious outlook on the stock market's future. So this incident just made my decision easier.
But this morning was a real shocker — I read that even NPS money is being invested in this  IPO. I saw SBI and HDFC listed among the investors. That’s absolutely disheartening. People invest in NPS with their hard-earned savings for
retirement
, and it’s being funneled into what looks like a scam IPO.
Is it too much to ask that our money — especially retirement money — be invested responsibly? I’m honestly scared to dig deeper now. What if NPS money is also being used to buy into companies like Zomato, Swiggy, Paytm, Mamaearth, and the like?
I get that when fund managers track an index, some exposure to such companies becomes unavoidable. But actively chasing these IPOs with public money is just unacceptable.",

indianstockmarket,https://old.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1elaju9/is_this_the_reason/,957,102,Is this the reason?,"My financial advisor sent this. Looks legit and makes sense.
💥Entire world market  downturn is related to the Japanese currency, Yen. Here's the sequence of events: Nothing to do with Israel - Iran war..💥
Two weeks ago, the Japanese Yen was trading at 165 Yen per 1 USD (i.e., 1 USD = 165 Yen).
For over 30 years, Japan has maintained zero interest rates (even on loans, there was zero interest).
Many organizations, funds, and hedge funds took advantage of this by borrowing large amounts from Japan and investing it in the US markets (double benefit of zero interest money and the dollar always appreciating against the Yen).
Additionally, since the investment was substantial, most hedge funds also shorted the Yen to hedge their positions (similar to selling call options for easier money).
Everything was going smoothly; people had been making free money for years, and this is why Japan is the largest investor in US markets due to its zero-interest money.
What changed? Last week, the JCB (Japan Central Bank, similar to RBI in India) decided to raise interest rates by 25 bps after almost 30+ years. And from here, everything changed.
Now, zero interest money is no longer zero interest, and there is an additional cost on all your existing loans. Hence, most of the funds that had taken this free interest loan and invested it in the US market started selling off everything to get the money and close the loan (because the US market was already overbought and now these loans no longer had zero interest)
Due to the increase in interest, the Yen started appreciating against the dollar, reaching 1 USD = 145 Yen (this was a significant increase in currency value in just 2 days).
Now, most of the people who had shorted the Yen (as mentioned in point 4) had to cover their positions because the Yen appreciated significantly in just 2 days. Their call options, which were in between, started moving wildly like the Sensex.
Now imagine you took a loan in Yen when 1 USD = 165 Yen and invested it in the US market. Suddenly, 1 USD = 145 Yen, so regardless of your returns, you have a direct cross-currency loss of 13%. (Assume you took a loan of 16,500 Yen which was equal to 100 USD, and now 16,500 Yen is equal to 113 USD. Even if there is no interest, you have a direct loss of 13% due to the Yen appreciating.)
In such a scenario, wouldn’t you sell everything to save yourself? What is the solution to this situation?
The simple solution is that the US needs to lower its interest rates to counter this. If a mountain is formed somewhere, it has to be countered elsewhere. If the mountain is in Japan, the US will have to act. 
The Indian market suffered primarily due to heavy selling by Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) as a result of the panic in Japan and the US.
This is the big reason markets are getting negative as fiis have to take out invested money to repay. Most important once these things are settled again Nifty will start moving to 24800 and 25000",
indianstockmarket,https://old.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1nlnarj/president_donald_trump_announced_a_100000_annual/,948,200,"President Donald Trump announced a $100,000 annual application fee for companies sponsoring H-1B visas","Previously, the H-1B program allowed US firms to hire highly skilled workers from abroad, often at salaries well above the federal minimum.
The lottery-based system meant millions applied, but only 85,000 visas were granted each year. Indians, as the dominant group, accounted for
over 70% of all approved H-1B applicants
.
Under the new rules, every H-1B application will now cost sponsoring companies $100,000 per year, so a three-year visa jumps to a $300,000 direct cost before you even touch salary, benefits, or relocation.
Indian IT majors like TCS, Infosys, Cognizant, and Wipro, along with global giants like Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta, rely heavily on H-1B visas to staff US-based projects. Amazon alone received over 12,000 H-1B approvals in early 2025, Microsoft and Meta, over 5,000 each.
At $100,000 a year, the math becomes unsustainable for mass hiring, especially for entry- and mid-level roles that dominate Indian IT’s US workforce.
This fee will disproportionately affect Indian professionals.
Not only do they make up the bulk of H-1B holders, but many Indian tech workers enter the US at lower to mid-level salaries compared to their American counterparts.
Those who can afford it may still sponsor the most senior or specialized talent, but entry-level and mid-career Indian engineers could see their US opportunities dry up.
Some analysts predict a surge in offshoring, with companies moving more jobs back to India or to other lower-cost destinations. This could boost Indian IT employment domestically, but at the cost of disrupting a decades-old model of global service delivery.
For Indian students graduating from US universities, the new fee is a gut punch. Many pursue STEM degrees with the hope of securing an H-1B after graduation. With entry-level salaries rarely covering the new visa fee, many may reconsider the US as a career destination, opting instead for Canada, Europe, or back to India.
For Indian professionals, the US dream just got a lot more expensive.",
