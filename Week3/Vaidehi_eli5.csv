This is an opportunity to ask for explanations for concepts related to the stock market. All other questions related to the stock market will be removed and users directed here.
How does buying and selling stocks work?
What is short selling?
What is a short squeeze?
What is stock manipulation?
What is a hedge fund?
What other questions about the stock market do you have?
In this thread, top-level comments (direct replies to this topic) are allowed to be questions related to these topics as well as explanations. Remember to follow all other rules, and discussions unrelated to these topics will be removed.
Please refrain as much as possible from speculating on recent and current events.
By all means, talk about what has happened, but this is not the place to talk about what will happen next, speculate about whether stocks will rise or fall, whether someone broke any particular law, and what the legal ramifications will be. Explanations should be restricted to an objective look at the mechanics behind the stock market.
EDIT: It should go without saying (but we'll say it anyway) that any trading you do in stocks is at your own risk.
ELI5 is not the appropriate place to ask for or provide advice on stock buy, selling, or trading.",

We have come to learn some very sad news recently,
u/bossgalaga
, the founder of
r/Explainlikeimfive
, has unfortunately passed away. In his honor we wanted to post the links of two charities that were dear to him:
The Immune Deficiency Foundation
The Institute for Effective Education
We are forever grateful for what he has created and hope you will consider supporting charitable organizations as he did.  As our regulars may recognize this post is out of character for us but as a mod team we felt these circumstances were unique. This post will stay up for a week, and we will include links to those charities in our wiki.
Additionally, it has come to our attention that
u/bossgalaga
made a post in
/r/askreddit
on July 28th, 2011 (ten years ago yesterday) asking if people would be interested in a sub dedicated to, ""...ask(ing) questions that some people might find obvious -- and to do so without fear of being downvoted, made fun of, or ignored."" This, of course, led to the start of
r/explainlikeimfive
. If you're interested in reading that post,

Thank you all for the kind words thus far.
